 Introduction
 Where disruptive technology taking us? Take leave it, disruptive technology always creates jobs much depleted jobs. You might notice certain jobs disappearing jobs jobs transform humans robots, machines, technology creating machines replace them.  Technology creates data analysis tools manipulate create custom scenarios using artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data Machine Learning (ML) algorithms predict drive consumer behavior. Data Analytics tools, Google Analytics , others available today free, and, used correctly, help organizations save millions, maybe billions dollars sales marketing.
 How machine replace humans?
 Before go on, think it’s level set constitutes machines. In context article , machines describe computers computerized equipment, like robots, programmed learn, sometimes like humans. Occasionally call Artificial Intelligence (AI), times call machine learning, times call robotics. And yes, technically different things. These bots efficient humans specific domains growing smarter passing day. They really tough tasks considered difficult human being.  But, within broad discussion related future work, totally interrelated. Factory floors deploy robots increasingly driven machine learning algorithms adjust people working alongside them. A machine work efficiently abundant data information work imparted daily them. But every forward step & advancement technology, a threat proliferating, a threat replaced work front. Every passing day sealing jobs humans globe. Similarly, AI used turn hand-drawn sketches (done humans) digital source code.
 Role Machines Companies future:
 Companies clearly developing AI robotics expertise idea technological innovations they’ll able to
 cut costs
 increase efficiencies
 offer value propositions
 execute business models or
 above.
 Of course, it’s machines creatives working together either. In another example, Amazon employed 100,000 robots warehouses efficiently move things around increased warehouse workforce 80,000. Humans, Amazon’s case, picking packing goods robots move orders around giant warehouses, essentially cutting “down walking required workers, making Amazon pickers efficient less tired.” Plus, robots “allow Amazon pack shelves together like cars rush-hour traffic longer need aisle space humans. The greater density shelf space means inventory roof, means better selection customers.”
 Why Machines replace humans?
 During next decades (or maybe sooner), notion work whether handled a human a virtual hinge predictability. As starting today, machines manage routine humans take unpredictable – tasks require creativity, problem-solving, flexibility. In context, robotics seen a means improve operations efficiency also improve quality life workers.
 Although obvious human factors involved a work activity impact job automation, also true highly repetitive tasks—and even mechanical ones—are ideal robots. Besides greater efficiency speed, automation leads a lower risk accidents, greater control autonomy, all, fewer costs organizations.
 Are Machines diligent humans?
 Although artificial intelligence machine learning make us believe robots endowed superior intelligence, fact don’t yet ability learn experience respond unknowns. So things stand, however much processing speed automatic learning a robot has, doesn’t beat factors innate human brain. Humans a essential part process. Think delivering services a client. Most customer challenges routine, humans play a important role addressing issues, solving time appear, consolidating process system.
 Machines vs. Humans – Which premium?
 While machines humans placed proximity,  robots expensive, doesn’t apply types, especially based Robotic Process Automation (RPA), development process incorporates algorithms significantly reduce costs.
 Moreover, think domestic robots—be a vacuum cleaner, a lawn mower a pool cleaner—are increasingly part daily lives. This level consumption robotics attained makes affordable automate tasks modern homes obtain greater control, security comfort.
 Man Machines together
 The division humans machines clear – I’m here, machine – boundary getting fuzzier. Smart prosthetics fuse seamlessly bodies, making lost limbs providing additional strength, stability, resilience, seen exoskeletons donned assembly line workers.
 We use smartphones symbiotically, integrated directly bodies? Think a smartphone form a contact lens capable transparently delivering augmented reality images straight brain. Think sounds like science fiction? Think again. The prototypes already built.
 Soon, brain-computer interfaces could become seamless well, creating a synergistic relationship cloud us. At point, question knows would moot; ask a question know answer. Sometimes answer stored neural circuitry, time would come connection neurons web. Our brain’s decision process influenced “educated” cultural context. These external factors influencing decision processes point certain situations, legitimately claim influence strong brains can’t held accountable choices made. The point I’m trying make humans symbiosis cultural environment tools – physical conceptual – taught use. My guess transformation subtle.
 Conclusion
 Practically speaking, robots growing point take world start creating smarter, better robots impractical even a concern. None expected near future, a long shot. If you’ve ATM, waited a PC boot a catastrophic failure, a game crash box reach a checkpoint, understand a world machines everything perfectly right. Before take jobs, need able theirs’ flawlessly; then, depend humans mess lives. 
 This isn’t a win-or-lose situation. We’re going wind a partner smarter machines, partnership fostered augmentation technology. Machines play essential role augmentation and, successful technology, fall level perception. In end, revolution silent invisible.
