The dominance celebrities swaying opinions acolyte well-established – advertisements print pixel mediums, brand endorsements, integrations, evidence exploiting celebrity influence vast. However, today ever before, influence creeping away world consumerism governance, policy, politics. With increasing number public figures overtly taking strong stronger political stances, making moves charged a political motive, eventually entering sphere legislature bureaucracy, scope a public influence come mean much used to, thereby begging question – well-placed personage world politics? Should celebrities allowed join politics?
 The interplay seemingly contrasting worlds celebrities policy-makers come increasing contact, India rest world-leading pop-music artists back presidential candidates, internationally acclaimed actors attempt international diplomacy, films claimed vehicles political messaging, Prime Ministerial banquets engage celluloid stars, on. The ‘influence’ stars exert world politics seems encapsulate entire spectrum involvement – zenith celebrities actually set foot parliamentary assemblies councils, represent public influenced.
 Although phenomenon seeping public influence public policy stretched much 20th century, Choi Berger (2001) suggest celebrity-politics connect continues strengthen, much a decades ago, trudge century. Of myriad causalities underlie circumstance, global internet, fame isn’t restricted confines tangible achievement theorized a significant driver. In 2009 book, Hyde labels spectacle a ‘mission creep’, enterprise celebrities expanding beyond primary goals.
 A prodigious public following seems parallel worlds politics personage, paves path celebrities cross politics. Celebrities seem able transition politics a certain grace, already learned live public’s eye, established themselves, allowing carry-over already-known traits celebrities role policy-makers. The visibility autochthonous politicians work years nurture, celebrities already descend political sphere. In best-known instances a celebrity transitioning politics, Ronald Reagan walked away Hollywood White House, carrying trademark charismatic on-screen personality spilled politics. Initially serving governor California 15 years late 1960s, Reagan served terms Oval Office. The voters knew Ronald – closely followed trends red blue – also not, giving Reagan edge propelled towards success. On side globe, India saw much trend on-screen persona aiding creation off-screen political career. Ramanand Sagar’s television series ‘Ramayan’, based Hindu mythological epic, revolutionary pious Indian society 1980s television shows novel. It recounted occasion audiences would often offer prayers television screen, every time Arun Govil, portrayed deity ‘Ram’ made appearance screen. Having garnered a devout, dutiful fan following, Govil, co-actors show turned world politics, godly association public’s eyes helped make a mark. Even Philippines shown ample evidence celebrities time swooping claim political victory stardom popularity, opponents lack.
 Very often, sentiment anti-incumbency seems golden ticket lets celebrity politicians snatch political power consummate politicians. Indeed, various political theorists suggest anti-incumbency happens amongst effective strategies secure vote banks. Until 31st December 2018, Ukrainian actor, screenwriter, director Volodymyr Zelensky played lead a sitcom tells story a schoolteacher accidentally becomes president. It winter Zelensky claimed contesting presidential elections “change mood timbre political establishment” “bring professional, decent people power”. Zelensky took premise wildly popular show reel real, crushed rival, a seasoned politician, incumbent Poroshenko a landslide victory. Has Zelensky proved a better representative people predecessor? Time yet deliver verdict. But gushes invoked people Ukraine, plea oust ‘the ruling class’ played role assuring Zelensky 73% plebiscite. In early 2010s India, similar anti-incumbent sentimentalities played celebrities including musician Vishal Dadlani, hockey legend Dhanraj Pillay, singer Jaspinder Narula, others – joined hands Arvind Kejriwal’s  ‘Aam Aadmi’ movement aimed rid existing political system ills.
 And so, innumerable celebrities across countries cultures claim throne. In fact, a Wikipedia page maintains inventory actor-politician spanning atlas claims ‘may never able satisfy particular standards completeness’ – depicting sheer number celebrities reroute politics. This begets questioning congruence world personage politics. 
 In a research article published 1995, Meyer Gamson articulated possibility celebrities choosing politically address broadly acceptable social causes understand power rests staying popular, thereby failing make appreciable difference. This seems ring true celebrity politicians India, especially ones nominated Upper House Parliament fail abysmally leave a mark. One representatives Gautam Gambhir, a cricketer-turned-politician mostly shunned abject performance parliament. Hema Malini, another popular actress turned politics, came heavy criticism claim a protector women’s rights wasn’t backed effort fulfill promises. Owing instances, research findings Nisbett DeWalt (2016) find public often questions intentions celebrities venture politics. It also seem entering politics failing deliver, celebrity politicians often deprive grass-root political workers chance enter mainstream politics.
 However, ample evidence around globe goes prove celebrities can, fact, make mark world governance, independent primary identities.

 More often not, celebrity engagement politics used woo voters younger strata population. Empirical studies Austin, Vord, Pinkleton, Epstein (2008), conclusively shown enhance political engagement younger voters.  Along similar lines, Jackson (2008) found young people likely agree political positions endorsed politicians. In fact, modern political theorists belief involvement celebrities politics allows otherwise uninvolved apathetic veins demographic, active participants democracy. Hillary Clinton aimed got Billboard-topping artists Beyonce Jay-Z take center-stage rally Cleveland, weeks leading 2016 US presidential elections – fact, multiple sources suggest, rally a surge millennial supporters. In a case, might benefit community celebrities endorse engage politics order nurture a vibrant engaged youth.   
 From vantage point today, relationship personage politics seems a central fixture society stay. What remains done, however, ensure symbiotic course relationship – scrutinize critique celebrities knock doors politics secure promises beneficence non-maleficence public seeks serve. Yet, seem benchmarks need met servants people – celebrity not, world live in, certainly case. Politicians – celebrity not, largely happen upon sphere governance without a lot experience backing learn navigate maze politics job. Ultimately, like things democracy, government people representatives them, them. The eventual endorsement leaders – celebrity – come, data-based analyses elaborate critique, people. Should celebrities allowed enter politics? The question remains unanswered. Or rather, answered democratic exercise – beeps electronic ballots election election, people – real ‘influencers’, choose.
