 The Covid- 19 pandemics forced factories shut down, flights getting canceled a massive decrease global economy, a significant decrease Green House Gases (GHG) developed developing countries.
 The SARS- CoV2 came spotlight December 2019 impacted countries till then. Nearly 131 million peoples infected worldwide resulting deaths around 2.9 Million according World Health Organisation (WHO). Most countries dealt virus imposing strict lockdowns social distancing control spread virus. These policies caused adverse effects worldwide. One important impacts Covid-19 Pandemic environment.
 There positive impacts environment due lockdown like, air pollution decreased dramatically, people asked stay houses due lockdowns. There also a sharp decline environmental noise. Environmental noise well defined unwanted harmful outdoor sounds caused human activities like noise emitted road traffics, air traffics, rail traffics, industrial activities. It important challenges modern era noise pollution cause adverse effects humans well harm animals too. The imposition lockdown quarantine various nation’s governments caused people remain back homes. Because this, movement people place a different place reduced significantly use personal public transport also decreased. Due changes, environmental noise generated cities dropped substantially.
 Water Pollution beaches reduced significantly animals spotted back cities, covid-19 virus also generated negative indirect effect environment.
 To begin with, developed countries halted sustainability program pandemic. In United States European nation-States, waste recycling plants suspended municipalities cities due concern virus getting spread recycling centers. This resulted increase use single-use plastic bags instead re-usable bags leading restaurants, firms, corporations. For instance, Starbucks, a leading coffee company month March 2020, announced a short-lived ban utilization recyclable reusable cups.
 Furthermore, people staying indoors lockdown majority department stores, shops, restaurants, food outlets closed, making online purchase food delivery quite high. This created consumption demand fossil fuels due transportation mobility goods individual. There enormous upsurge medical waste- products employed healthcare professionals usually single-use items used disposed of. Some wastes include used masks, personal protection kits, gloves. For instance, nearly 200 tons medical waste generated peak pandemic breakout Wuhan, China. This 50 tones average waste generated outbreak Wuhan.
 These organic inorganic wastes generated due policies crafted government takes a heavy toll environment cause environmental issues like water pollution, air pollution, soil erosion, harm local flora fauna.
 The demand masks pandemic become skyrocketing materials required production masks highly dangerous environment generally composed non-woven fabrics. Polyester, Polystyrene, polyethylene, polycarbonate, common materials used surgical mask density lying 20grams 25 grams/sq. meter. These materials mostly resistant liquids plastic-based products a really high afterlife discarded. If treated properly without discarding, end filling landfills oceans making dangerous aquatic lifeforms. For example, recently environment Hong Kong started degrading drastically pandemic accumulation clinical wastes.
 With recycling plants hold, piles small mountains wastes depositions open areas formed due increasing number unrecycled wastes generated every day. This makes surrounding vulnerable also creating a high risk air pollutions dumped open wastes decays Methane (CH4), a greenhouse gas, hence increasing risk global warming too.  Not surroundings getting affected careless methods, local people also getting affected. If excess methane gets accumulated Earth’s atmosphere due piles unrecycled wastes, could result increases Earth’s average temperature harmful future generations.
 Many protected endangered flora fauna facing much greater risks due imposition lockdown. Many countries lockdown made people stay inside homes. The employees, NGOs, volunteers working protected areas like National Parks, Marine Conservation Zones, wildlife sanctuaries made stay home making protected endangered flora fauna unattended. This also led increase illegal activities like wildlife hunting, illegal deforestation, fishing activities due absence people. The prohibition eco-tourism also led a significant financial drop economy protected areas.
 Some nations like China asked local authorities native government bodies increase amount disinfection routine, mainly increase dosage chlorine wastewater treatment plant prevent spread COVID-19 virus. However, according (2020), solid evidence found survival virus lifespan virus wastewater well drinking water. Despite fact excessive amounts chlorine water cause harmful problems issues associated people’s health like bladder cancer also damages cells.
 The COVID-19 a reminder health planet also linked health humans. Evidence proves virus zoonotic, meaning transmitted people animals. They accountable seventy-five percent emerging infectious diseases World. With Virus infecting millions people every day across globe, Various governments agencies’ top priority regulate spread virus shifting spotlight management treatment wastes (especially clinical medical waste).  Likewise, time, responsible individuals need step follow necessary guideline precautions disposal waste medical gears.
 In Spite various data showing pollutions reduced significantly pandemic, History witnessed a rise pollution “post-financial crisis”.  A similar case observed 2008 financial crash – although a temporary decrease emissions 1.3% observed, economy recovered 2010, emissions all-time high. After all, sheer mutual empathy goodwill world emerge stronger global pandemic. To prevent future outbreaks, must address regularly threats ecosystems wildlife, including habitat loss, illegal trade, pollution, climate change human life depends Earth’s life.
 If live near a spacious outdoor area, like desert empty road lined trees realize it’s safe, surface-less space take a walk in, begin realize beauty nature. The point remain indoors, avoid close contact others. When leave home, whether a walk desert a run street, make sure wipe surfaces come contact with, avoid touching face, frequently wash hands.
