 When people hear AI often think sentient robots magic boxes. AI today much mundane simple—but doesn’t mean it’s powerful. Another misconception high-profile research projects applied directly business situation. AI done right create extreme return investments (ROIs)—for instance automation precise prediction. But take thought, time, proper implementation. We seen success value generated AI projects increased a grounded understanding expectation technology deliver C-suite down.
 “Artificial Intelligence (AI) a science a set computational technologies inspired by—but typically operate quite differently from—the ways people use nervous systems bodies sense, learn, reason take action.”3 Lately a big rise day-to-day use machines powered AI. These machines wired using cross-disciplinary approaches based mathematics, computer science, statistics, psychology, more.4 Virtual assistants becoming common, web shops predict purchases, companies make use chatbots customer service companies use algorithms detect fraud.
 AI Deep Learning technology employed office entry systems bring proper time tracking employee. As system tries learn person image processing technology whose data feed forwarded a deep learning model Deep learning isn’t algorithm per se, rather a family algorithms implements deep networks (many layers). These networks deep methods computation, graphics processing units (GPUs), required train them, addition clusters compute nodes. So using deep learning take detect employee using face person recognition scan login, logout timing recorded. Using AI system even identify employee’s entry time, working hours, non-working hours tracking movement employee office system predict report HR salary employee based working hours. Our system take feed CCTV track movements employees system capable recognizing a person even he/she masked pandemic situation taking iris scan. With system installed inside office, following benefits:
 1)Compliance/litigation needs
 For several countries, regulations insist employer must keep documents available demonstrate working hours performed employee. In event control labor inspectorate a dispute employee, employer must able explain justify working hours company. This made easy system tracking employee movements
 2)Information security needs
 This monitoring user connection times detect suspicious access times. In event compromised credentials used log 3 a.m. a Saturday, a notification access could alert team attack possibly underway.
 3)Employee login logout software
 To manage react employees’ attendance, overtime thresholds, productivity, suspicious access times, system records stores detailed interactive reporting users’ connection times. These records allow better manage users’ connection times provide accurate, detailed data required management.
 4)If want avoid paying overtime, make sure employees respect certain working time quotas even avoid suspicious access. Our system alert HR officer employee’s office time accordingly take action.
 5)Last least reduces human resource needs keep track records sending report HR HR officials check report system reduce times human resource needs
 With use AI Deep Learning technologies, automate routines stuff functionality humans need resources keep track thereby reducing time spent manual data entry works rather companies think making position high competitive world.
