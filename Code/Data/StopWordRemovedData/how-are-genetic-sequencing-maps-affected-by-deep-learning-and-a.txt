 Artificial intelligence (AI) development computer systems perform tasks normally require human intelligence. Advances AI software hardware, especially deep learning algorithms graphics processing units (GPUs) power training, led a recent rapidly increasing interest medical AI applications. In clinical diagnostics, AI-based computer vision approaches poised revolutionize image-based diagnostics, AI subtypes begun show similar promise various diagnostic modalities. In areas, clinical genomics, a specific type AI algorithm known deep learning used process large complex genomic datasets.  AI main applications genetics: identification harmful genes treatment disease. Let’s take a look applications works. Also, good GPS trackers, implement vehicle. AI also used identify genetic mutations within tumors using 3D imaging. AI useful personalized medicine, requires treatments specified patient’s needs versus another. The 0.1% DNA unique us million differences.
 The rise AI genomics unsurprising. Genomics – a ‘big data’ field – requires computational approaches interrogate enormous volume data generated sequencing technologies marry meaningful ways biological clinical data. Analyzing datasets biological insights especially difficult rules explicitly predefined, step step, within computer code. Instead, machine learning techniques learn data without need specify explicit rules.
 Although a highly useful tool, AI without challenge key issue AI genomics scale – amount genomics data generated exponentially growing. Slavé Petrovski, Head Genome Analytics Informatics AstraZeneca’s Centre Genomics Research (GCR) says – “AI genomics extended across different omic studies, transcriptomics.” Although challenges infrastructure resources cope large datasets mine effectively managed correctly problem eliminated.
 Slavé Petrovski highlighted a key piece research, conducted AstraZeneca, presented a multi-dimensional machine learning framework, taking account 52 layers information including gene expression, human disease literature, mouse phenotypes. This approach proposed a “support framework objectively quantitatively triaging potential novel disease target genes.
 Another focus within genomic AI strengthening data. Petrovski remarks area “constantly evolving,” a key observation method adopted often important underlying data. This means information inputted AI systems must high quality cannot used full potential.
 Genetics always a data-driven science largely utilizes machine learning capture dependencies data derive biological hypotheses. However, ability extract insights exponentially increasing volume genomics data requires expressive machine learning models. By effectively combining large data sets, deep learning transformed field, now, becoming method choice genomics modeling tasks, including predicting impact genetic variation gene regulatory mechanisms DNA accessibility splicing.
 In recent years, deep learning widely used diverse fields biology. In biology, applications deep learning gaining increasing popularity predicting structure function genomic elements, promoters, enhancers, gene expression levels.
 The application deep learning genomic datasets exciting rapidly developing area primed revolutionize genome analysis. Deep learning successfully implemented areas image recognition robotics (e.g., self-driving cars) useful large amounts data available. In respect, using deep learning a tool field genomics entirely apt. Although somewhat early stages, deep learning genomics potential inform fields cancer diagnosis treatment, clinical genetics, crop improvement, epidemiology public health, population genetics, evolutionary phylogenetic analyses, functional genomics. Also, recent years, deep learning (DL) methods considered context genomic prediction. The DL methods nonparametric models provide flexibility adapt complicated associations data output adapt complex patterns. The applications deep learning (DL) methods genomic selection (GS) obtain a meta-picture GS performance highlight tools help solve challenging plant breeding problems. We also provide general guidance effective use DL methods including fundamentals DL requirements appropriate use. The main requirement using DL quality sufficiently large training data. There clear evidence DL algorithms capture nonlinear patterns efficiently conventional genome-based. Deep learning algorithms integrate data different sources usually needed GS shows ability improving prediction accuracy large breeding data. It important apply DL large training-testing data sets.
 Functional genomic analysis field deep learning made inroads date. The availability vast troves data various types (DNA, RNA, methylation, chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, chromosome interactions, forth) ensures enough training datasets build accurate prediction models relating gene expression, genomic regulation, variant interpretation. Other features identification long noncoding RNAs splice-site prediction also analyzed. As data becomes available, better models able trained, thus resulting even precise accurate predictions genomic features functions.
 Although deep learning holds enormous promise advancing genomics discoveries, also implemented mindfully appropriate caution. Deep learning applied biological datasets sufficient size, usually order thousands samples.
 Even though use AI deep learning solve problems related genomic data, use challenging cost-effective all. It needs high-quality machines skilled experts. But said – ” If it’s worth it’s nothing worry about.” But succeed applying concept deep learning AI genetics cost-effectiveness create a history world science biology possible humans reach heights genetics human genome.
