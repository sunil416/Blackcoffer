 ACADEMIA, RESEARCHERS, DECISION MAKERS POLICY MAKERS MANAGE CHALLENGES BROADER COLLABORATION PRIVACY HARNESS VALUE BIG DATA?
 For academia, researchers decision-makers, sectors like retail, healthcare, insurance, finance, capital markets, real estate, pharmaceutical, oil & gas, big data looks like a Eldorado: a fantastic mine information hope find key great discoveries. In social sciences, humanities, etc., example, questions “what social media data telling us societies, humanities, consumers, people live nearby?” “how big data used efficiently allocate resources, energy capital technology manpower?” becoming frequent.
 Quite naturally, academia abuzz, thinking use big data, big data technologies & platforms. It also teeming competitiveness, researchers race make discoveries waiting us massive data centers.
 A cautious approach
 That said, academics, researchers especially universities, must exercise caution. There unique risks must taken account, risks stem academic research (in cases) made publicly available. Therefore, results obtained, methods used, often data collected a research project eventually made publicly available. This level transparency unique academia. So however magical big data appear, using requires careful considerations data protection laws research ethical principles.
 Concretely, using data produced individuals, must take care respect privacy processing data, must also ensure content produced cannot used against them. Further precautions must taken working data vulnerable individuals, young children teenagers, instance.
 In respect, considerable experience universities handle human subject data within life sciences great help existing research protocols devised context adapted address challenges posed big data.
 From big data big collaboration
 Researchers statistics mathematics mindful interact closely with, concepts law ethics. This examples collaborations interactions across academic fields driven use exploration big data. The reason big data requires a wider
 Big data requires a wider range expertise applied simultaneously answer research questions
 range expertise applied simultaneously answer research questions. In contrast, understand smaller, traditional data sets used long ago, knowing data methods would sufficient tackle projects.
 Consider effort understand drivers behind memes Twitter. A meme idea, behavior, style spreads person person within a culture. A typical research project could, example, try understand memes develop, spread why? Such a project would require a software engineer able produce database necessary manage large data set; a statistician machine-learner develop proper methodology explore data learn properties; a linguist help efficiently mine tweets identifying relevant semantic structures; a social scientist interpret results frame research questions, on.
 One challenges academia culture collaboration scale field yet. Finding right skills synergies produce efficient teamwork challenge academics face tackling a big data project.
 The changing nature data
 But size big data requires different skills. In sense, term ‘big data’ misleading. What makes big data different data collected.
 Traditionally data collected a specific purpose, relating a specific scientific question. Academics sought delineate a scientific question, build appropriate techniques answer question, finally collect appropriate data set use technique on. This systematic process led, hopefully, answer.
 This tradition dates back Greek Antiquity when, instance, Eratosthenes measured angle sun different locations, used geometry compute circumference globe.
 In setting, a clear research question: circumference globe? To address question, Eratosthenes used geometry identify find answer: angle sun different locations. Then, found accurately measure information: using a gnomon.
 The research project presented clear steps could addressed independently. This paradigm shifting. The problem big data poses academics data scientist, general, extracting value insight data requires processes simultaneously: discovering informational content extract it. The ‘where’ ‘how’ must done time.
 This comparison Eldorado a gold rush appropriate: know valuable information extracted big data, know exactly find data set extract it.
 Consider Twitter memes introduced above. The research question interest example evolution memes drivers. To address question, must define information found extract it.
 The answer questions intuition data set (tweets published online) contains a massive amount information memes: ones currently trending, form spread, etc. However, unclear information found corpus (should automatically detect a meme? a data-expert list memes?). There also methodology extract information located (what measures use describe memes evolutions? How measures relate? What measures computationally feasible?). Finally, questions must answered simultaneously coherently address problem.
 The successful solution date frame focused research questions aim capture information interested in, nothing else. Defining scope project broadly runs risk corrupting extracted information limits ability extract information a scalable way. In effect, reduce confusion caused addressing ‘how’ ‘why’ time, research questions must precise well defined.
 Using big data understand networks
 The need a focused approach made concrete considering network analysis. A network made individual entities relationships them. These range human social networks, neural network, electric networks, protein interaction networks, example.
 We would expect methods analyzing type network would apply others. This true principle, however, research problem interest network different. For instance, considering a social network, often interested communities form interact. When considering protein interaction networks, interested role a particular protein plays overall network.
 In terms methodology, addressing simultaneously global scale community problem (in social networks) local scale role problem (in protein networks) remains open question. But, addressing problem separately, efficient methods devised. Therefore, research question must focus aspects: either local global.
 The incompatibility approaches due different mathematical tools used address problems. For community detection, network regarded a large matrix, tools usually rely eigenvectors matrix.
 On hand, determine role node, network considered a graph occurrence small shapes around a given node enumerated. The former algebraic nature, later combinatorial nature, straightforward articulate approaches a single method.
 One set tools needed identify community a given agent belongs to, another describe role a given agent. However, isn’t a tool both. As a consequence, necessary decide aspects studied advance.
 A threefold challenge
 Like sectors like healthcare, retail, capital market, energy more, academia sees potential big data. To harness potential, academics face a threefold challenge: generate teams varied expertise, work focused yet meaningful research problems, taking ethical questions account. Many efforts appearing academia, are, hopefully, expect a great breakthrough near future.
