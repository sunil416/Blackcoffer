 Defense crucial a nation’s well-being progress. For reason, every country assigns tantamount importance it. To protect interests, a nation guard land, seas, air (with addition space recently anti-satellite missile). Just like sectors, technology impacted defense well. Continual improvements made design guns, missiles, submarines, ships, planes, on. At time, efforts made minimize human loss wars. One ways would employ expendable machines could work. The concept enables machines artificial intelligence.
 The immediate thing might come mind a Terminator-like soldier completely replace humans. However, even close reality difficulties involved. At present, AI cannot level multitasking, cannot react difficult situations, also confused enemies. Given a wonderful article Lt. Col (Ret) Paul Maxwell Cyber Fellow Computer Engineering Army Cyber Institute United States Military Academy illustrates this.
 However, author says, AI used maintenance applications determine a system going fail needs repair. A similar kind application analyze medical condition a soldier predict operability treated it.
 The right enhance overall power armed forces; machines must act force multipliers, assist humans, replace them. This objective countries presently working achieve.
 Let us consider land warfare. Soldiers push battlefield, face enemy attacks possibly sustain fatal wounds. Moreover, terrains difficult dangerous humans access. This problem reduced considerably using following technologies: UGV (unmanned ground vehicle) sentry guns.
 UGVs come various sizes small bag-sized medium-sized tanks. This variety roles employed in. The small ones ideal reconnaissance purposes, mine detection, bomb disposal, small assault operations. This small size makes difficult detect also enables access inaccessible places. India already developed Daksh purposes. Another notable example Gladiator UGV US. The US also trying develop ball robots purposes.
 Autonomous tanks useful assist conventional tanks acting a security cover also carrying assault operations carrying essential gear. The Milrem UGV used Estonian troops Mali Africa carrying supplies ammunition. Mostly technology development approved, useful a nation.
 A link UGV info given below.
 Sentry guns static devices. They basically powered machine guns rotate a fixed point fire automatically targets using cameras sensors. They useful comes defense a place invading enemies. A battery guns installed various points around specified place. Thus sentry guns extremely useful prevent defending soldiers becoming exposed targets. South Korea uses system demilitarized zone North Korea South Korea.
 Autonomous technologies also applied water. There certain operations minesweeping stand-by a high threat ships involved. For these, use autonomous boats UGV (unmanned underwater vehicles).
 Autonomous boats useful protect bigger ships standing idle exposed. They also carry reconnaissance assault operations. The US Navy currently trying make boats operational.
 Underwater, submarine combat vehicle. In present times, underwater warfare become complex due adoption stealth technologies, like acoustic dampening anti-submarine technologies deployed air. This also increases number staff submarines required handle situations increases threat significant casualties. However, use UUV would significantly reduce problems thus countries like USA, China whose navies largest world, trying incorporate technology increase dominance.
 AI implemented aerial attacks successfully form drones UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle). Almost countries implemented technology. These aircraft like remote control planes, a bigger. Here AI used identify targets ground communicate operator. India Rustom, Netra, Lakshya, various drones/UAV’s. However, US trying produce unmanned fighter jet escort manned fighter planes, transport aircraft, engage aerial combat.
 All technologies work either independently operated remotely. When operate independently, collect information battlefield using sensors, using AI, makes decisions. When used remotely, i.e. operated a person a different place behave pretty much like remote control devices.
 The great advantage technology human intervention thus casualty reduced. Also, cost producing technology considerably lower producing manned machines. The significant use involves ‘swarming’, similar swarming bees around intruder. When deployed packs, encircle enemy devastate them. Loss machines cause significant loss; expendables, easily replaceable.
 Warfare a front nowadays: Cyber Front. The recent Solar Winds hack a clear example emphasizing this. As world becomes increasingly digital, nations entities (can called terrorists) look forward exploiting advantage. Most attacks done objective: extract sensitive confidential data. Using data, a country’s money stolen, electrical blackouts caused even worse, country’s defense paralyzed facilitating foreign attack. Coming size data, HUGE (in PB). Processing kind volume requires techniques like big data. And identify weak spots millions accounts networks, hackers might using AI ML (Machine learning). Just like them, cybersecurity officials use AI ML predict simulate cyber-attacks identify weak spots cybersecurity.  Now comes uses better technology techniques. AI counter AI.
 However, a concern applies sectors using AI: Will AI replace humans? Will rule us? The answer yes use much AI. The applies defense sector also. The applications discussed act force multipliers long humans control them. AI never replace soldiers, perform tasks risky impossible humans. AI allowed become intelligent allowed operate independently. Machine learning confined familiarize battlefield situations, think ahead us act arbitrarily. Before a device fires a bullet own, a human must happens according will. Another concern hacking. What enemy hacks devices? Such concerns must addressed adding multiple layers encryption limiting amount communication possible. Take, example, a regular ‘nonsmart’ washing machine. We cannot communicate pressing buttons. Nor anything washing clothes. This could done unmanned vehicles. Communication must restricted user machine. The device perform intended duty. If a nation learns harness balance use technology, defense sector also sectors stronger ensure nation’s holistic development.
