 AI allows training go naturalistic simulations a simple computer-driven algorithms cannot. The advent natural speech ability AI  computer draw instantly a large database scenarios means response questions, decisions, advice a trainee challenge a humans cannot health medicine
 Health monitoring:
 Wearable health trackers-like FitBit, Apple, Garmin, others- monitor health rate activity levels. They send alerts user get exercise share information doctors.
 Technology applications apps encourage healthier behavior individuals help proactive management a healthy lifestyle.
 AI increases ability healthcare professionals better understand day-to-day patterns needs people care, better feedback, guidance, support.
 Medical imaging:
 Machine learning algorithms process unimaginable amounts information blink eye provide precision humans spotting even smallest detail medical imaging.  A Blackford, Zebra, Enlitic, Lunit.
 The company “Zebra Medical Vision” developed a platform called profound, analyzes types medical imaging reports able find every sign potential conditions osteoporosis, aortic aneurysms, a 90% accuracy rate.
 Digital consultation:
 For eg, digital health firm #HealthTap developed “Dr. AI”, apps like Babylon UK use AI give medical consultations based personal medical history common medical knowledge. Users report symptoms app, uses speech recognition compare against a database illness asks patients specify symptoms triage whether go ED, urgent care, a primary care doctor.
 AI robot-assisted surgery: Robots used medicine 30 years. Surgical robots either aid a human surgeon execute operations themselves. They’re also used hospitals labs repetitive tasks, rehabilitation, physical therapy, support long-term conditions.     
  Health chatbots Babylon, Ada, mostly close-ended communications.

 Examples AI healthcare medicine
 #MICROSOFT: Predictive analysis vision care
 #GOOGLE: clinical decision support breast cancer diagnosis
 #IBM WATSON: precision medicine population health management
 Actionable medical insights:  An ever-increasing amount medical data digitized public private healthcare institutions. However, nature, kind data messy unstructured. Unlike types business data, traditional statistical methods used quick insights, patient data particularly amenable simple modeling analytics tools.
  For eg.- Enlitic, a San Francisco-based start-up, a mission mixing intelligence empathy leverage power AI health medicine precisely generating.
 Therefore, a massive parallel effort rationalize legal policy-making needed bring full benefit advancement AI technologies healthcare space. As technologies AI/ML enthusiasts, hope a bright future power intelligence.
