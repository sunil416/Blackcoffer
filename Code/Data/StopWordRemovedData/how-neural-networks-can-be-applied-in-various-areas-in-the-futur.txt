 Everything You Need Know About Future Neural Networks. Neural networks arguably technological development potential currently horizon. Through neural networks, could feasibly handle almost computational contemplative task automatically, someday, greater processing power human brain. For now, neural networks infancy, already, they’re impressive technology responsible tremendous breakthroughs everything speech recognition medical diagnoses. The question is, go here?
 How Neural Networks Work Today
 Let’s start talking neural networks, neural nets, work today current form. Neural nets computer programs assembled thousands millions units, designed function artificial neuron. When “trained,” a neural network typically fed information, allowing recognize patterns like spotting familiar faces photos identifying correct hit a tennis ball. With feedback, neural networks work modify processed problem, “learning” better long periods time. When done training, neural nets solve a wide variety different problems. They notice deviations historical patterns proactively, receive alerts events relevant business, automatically recognize trigger points a pattern (like picking a face a photo diagnosing a medical condition), perform complex operations without supervision (like playing a game).
 Key Strengths Neural Nets
 There several key strengths neural nets make a favorite choice AI developers,
 Performance problems variables. For a problem a strict set rules requirements, constrained inputs, it’s easy a machine work answer. The go-to example a calculator; rules mathematics never broken, relatively simple follow. Input variables (and real numbers), get sum easily. But identifying speech patterns diagnosing illnesses require far variables; machines need “understand” they’re looking for, it’s differentiated noise, might influenced different ways. Neural nets ridiculously good solving big problems—sometimes even better humans.
 Feature engineering. Neural nets also incredibly good figuring correct features ascribe a problem, known feature engineering. Let’s say you’re trying teach algorithm play (and win) a game Go, Google did. Go a game practically limitless move possibilities clear determining whether a move “good” “bad” (especially early game). For machine learn effectively, must able learn identify makes a move less likely get machine closer victory. Neural nets this; create categories consideration, apply work. Applicability. Neural nets also power flexibility. Once established, applied almost anything, whether it’s helping people spot issues interfering productivity improving air traffic patterns smoother flights. The core functionality a neural net learn something efficiently, a system learn recognize patterns, could feasibly recognize patterns almost domain.
 Key Weaknesses Neural Nets
 They said key weaknesses prevent neural nets seeing full-range applications: Data requirements. For starters, neural nets must go a “learning” period start recognize patterns refine themselves. While we’re able “teach” machines efficiently ever before, there’s a massive data requirement algorithms start effective. Depending application, could take 10,000 discrete sets data more. This could substantially increase time takes make a neural net effective limit possible applications.
 Expensiveness. Neural nets also expensive time-consuming develop. The computational processes needed handle variables incoming sets data demand CPU GPU power beyond scope a normal system. This makes a discouraging endeavor engineers, drives price a functional system, making harder use intended purposes. Difficulty blindness. As might imagine, realities developing a neural net much in-depth complicated implied a simple, overarching definition. It’s incredibly hard learn develop a neural net, engineers begin journey eventually drop running. On top that, intricacies neural nets, often don’t transparency algorithms coming conclusions; determine whether findings accurate, can’t exactly came answers, makes even mystifying—even professionals.
 Long-term potential. Neural nets already responsible significant advancements realm AI, terms long-term potential, much power possibilities, like kernel methods, even classical AI. There’s a hard limit efficient complicated neural nets get, upper limit discouraging researchers.
 What’s Store Future?
 With strengths fueling future neural nets weaknesses complicating things, could future hold incredible technology? Integration. The weaknesses neural nets could easily compensated could integrate complementary technology, like symbolic functions. The hard part would finding a systems work together produce a common result—and engineers already working it.
 Sheer complexity. Everything potential scaled terms power complexity. With technological advancements, make CPUs GPUs cheaper and/or faster, enabling production bigger, efficient algorithms. We also design neural nets capable processing data, processing data faster, learn recognize patterns 1,000 examples, instead 10,000. Unfortunately, upper limit advanced get areas—but haven’t reached limit yet, we’ll likely strive near future.
 New applications. Rather advancing vertically, terms faster processing power sheer complexity, neural nets could (and likely will) also expand horizontally, applied diverse applications. Hundreds industries could feasibly use neural nets operate efficiently, target audiences, develop products, improve consumer safety—yet it’s criminally underutilized. Wider acceptance, wider availability, creativity engineers marketers potential apply neural nets applications.
 Obsolescence. Technological optimists enjoyed professing glorious future neural nets, dominant form AI complex problem solving much longer. Several years now, hard limits key weaknesses neural nets stop pursued. Instead, developers consumers gravitate toward approach—provided becomes accessible enough, enough potential make a worthy successor.
 Regardless business goals are, there’s a good chance neural nets able help achieve them—if now, near future. Despite shortage developers, companies engineers working constantly refine neural net efforts, means we’re store a “golden age” neural networks (at least temporarily). It’s hard say whether neural net development continue indefinitely whether new, efficient technology take place, either way, breakthrough field AI deserves attention
 CONCLUSION
 Many big tech companies today receiving tons data users, comes profit power greater good society, it’s human nature go former instead, especially you’re a position choose. We live times attention capitalized constantly. We must live smarter act rationally prevent surrendering lives short bursts dopamine expedient trivial acts.
 We hope progress upcoming decades, people control decisions companies make betterment society civilization a whole. And data building systems serve us, make us productive, instead looking ways grab attention, build products provide value meaning lives.
