 Since last quarter 2014 oil prices plummeted $100/barrel less $30/barrel 2016. Currently, oil price hovering around $70/barrel. Events force O&G companies restructure upstream, midstream downstream operations. Refinery shutdowns, handling various grades crude oil, changing environmental regulations pushing gross refining margins a bare minimum. With use IoT, refineries plan shutdowns, minimize downtime, improve safety record. In fact, refineries incorporated IoT operations known Smart Refineries. IoT next step evolution oil gas industry. It play a significant role lower operating expenses increase reliability complete production plant. O&G companies around world focussing IoT increase overall efficiency decrease non-productive time well costs. Basically, IoT covers entire value chain Oil Gas industry right pinpointing location exploration oil wells refining crude oil transportation oil pipelines trucks. From trillions dollars spent every year exploration production (E&P), a small investment IoT reap huge benefits entire chain petroleum operations.
 Preventative Maintenance (PM)
 The O&G industry loses billions dollars every year due non-productive time (NPT). IoT could used help reduce NPT events using real-time data predict breakdowns schedule preventative maintenance. This a huge field application IoT. Preventive maintenance (PM) continuously monitoring certain parameters equipment, like vibration, temperature, oil levels parameters critical operation equipment, sensors. The sensors continuously relay real-time data receiver. Due this, management accurately determine need maintenance time spent repairing machine broken well greater losses organization face due production losses completely eliminated. In O&G sector, PM used pumps, compressors, heat exchangers, steam traps, relief valves equipment instrumentation expensive difficult failure lead high monetary losses. Billions dollars savings achieved industries incorporated IoT plants PM. The Petropiar refinery (Chevron/PDVSA joint venture) Mejorador Jose, Barcelona, Venezuela, installed predictive management software conjunction 4,500 HART field instruments. Using technologies enabled refinery increase production, reduce costs, improve profitability.[1]
 Smart Pipelines
 Pipelines form transportation backbone O&G industry. For a refinery, pipeline networks scale thousands kilometers, rugged lands mountains caring black gold. 24*7 maintenance supervision pipelines, terms theft, leaks, corrosion, important a huge network possible using wired technology. A pipeline leak cause oil leak a high flow rate due high-pressure differential created hence immediate leak detection plays a critical role. IoT along supervisory control data acquisition(SCADA) plays immensely important role here. Represented Schneider Electric Cisco “Smart Connected Pipeline”. It open, end-to-end solution pipeline management provides future-ready communication architectures integrated, automated pipeline operations use modern technologies[2].
 IoT enabled companies save millions dollars oil losses due pipeline leaks theft.
 Asset Management increase operational efficiency
 A typical petrochemical industry millions equipment large small hence asset-intensive industry. The assets range Pressure Relief Valves (PRVs) Heat Exchangers (HE) huge Distillation Columns (DC). Identifying efficient working larger equipment easy important parameters like temperature, pressure, flow, level wired DCS. It a failure smaller equipment goes unnoticed a period time leads operational inefficiency. When smaller equipment fitted sensors transformed a thing send data cloud system get real-time analysis complete operation quickly identify issue is.
 A classic example asset management a critical non-instrumented part Emerson’s Process Management’s successful implementation IoT Denka Singapore Pte Ltd., a subsidiary Denka chemical company world’s largest facilities continuous polymerizationSteam a important heating utility Denka. As steam travels pipes keeps condensing exchanging heat concerned process fluid becomes condensate. This along non-condensable gases removed done steam traps. An incorrectly operating steam trap results lower heating efficiency escape live steam; industry studies showing steam-trap failure rate region 20% a year (Denka’s 17%), given hundreds even thousands steam traps typical facility, cost consequences associated failure significant[3]. Denka’s approach towards correction steam traps like process facilities, manual checking a contractor annual basis. This caused a large amount steam go waste created financial well energy loss.
 To automate laborious process steam trap monitoring provide far frequent updates health steam traps Denka plant, Emerson Process Managementarchitected deployed a native IoT solution. At equipment level, sense (i.e. listen for) steam leakage, Emerson’s Rosemount 708 wireless acoustic transmitters configured a WirelesHART mesh network attached 148 critical (high pressure, high capacity) steam traps facility. Data collected WirelessHART gateways transmitted local telecom provider’s Singtel’s 3G cellular network analytics software (hosted a Microsoft Azure cloud platform) generation steam trap performance reports4. The acoustic patterns condensate different acoustic pattern steam. It change sensor monitors reports.
 Some fascinating facts IoT solution are:
 No involvement plant DCS thus alleviating common concerns interference security DCS.
 Implementation IoT solution simplified connection DCS.
 The complete system software, well sensors, provided upfront capital a monthly service fee thus capital expenditure replaced operational expenditure.
 The steam traps analyzed Denka Emerson’s Sensing Regional Centre, thus creating additional burden Denka.
 Creation a weekly extension report contains details failed steam traps needing replacement.
 Creation a monthly savings report containing information steam leakage equivalent financial loss.
 After implementing solution steam trap failure rate went 22% less 10% steam consumption decreased 7% directly impact increasing company’s bottom line.
 Smarter Oilfield Operations
 This example, smart operations a leading O&G service provider, taken Cognizant. The client wanted increase efficiency reduce operational costs thousands Electric Submersible Pumps (ESPs). ESPs lowered boreholes provide artificial lift underground pressure weak force oil surface. The engineer needs periodically reset pump’s motor speed optimize production. This depends good conditions, pressure, viscosity, well market prices. Historically, reprogramming pump profile requires dispatching engineer oilfield, a waste time also a costly proposition sometimes requires helicopter travel a dangerous land sea location.
 Cognizant began optimizing problem conducting end-to-end analysis current systems processes, identifying opportunities optimize software, hardware, processes regarding ESPs. Based analysis, Cognizant engineers developed IoT solution efficiently gather sensor information, analyze determine optimal ESP settings, program settings network. Using pump software developed Cognizant, client’s engineers could recalibrate pumps network, like adjusting motor speed according data generated software a clicks, instead traveling remote oilfields. This done a lot pumps time thus maximizing utilization oilfield well reducing costs. The interface enables engineers configure rules prevent equipment failure — example, shutting equipment drill temperature reaches 100 degrees resuming temperature falls 90 degrees[4]. Based software client also received alerts impending pump failures, thus enabling take preventative measures pump fails. The repair work much faster unplanned breakdowns reduced thus increasing productive time well customer satisfaction. The importance IoT clearly understood case efficiency operations greatly increased.
 There immense data generated Oil Gas industry rightly tapping understanding. This data beneficial.
