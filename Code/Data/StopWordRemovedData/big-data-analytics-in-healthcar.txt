 Quality affordable healthcare a vision governments across globe. The high cost Medical service lack sufficient infrastructure detrimental vision. In developed countries U.S., reducing healthcare cost agenda point politicians.  Even India, affordable healthcare important “Roti, Kapda Makan” near future.
 Technology play a big role reducing healthcare cost making efficient. The vast quantity data available Hospitals insurance providers. Big data play a big role analyzing data produce actionable insight. Some benefits using big data follows,
 Reduce Fraud Waste:
 Fraud a big impact everyone. In fact, National Healthcare Anti-Fraud Association estimates fraud costs Americans least $33 billion $55 billion annually – that’s approximately 3-5% nation’s health care spending $2.26 trillion. For example: Sometimes, providers hospitals report procedures services never provided.
 Big data analytics help insurance company discover frauds. Big data use a huge amount historical data identify expected procedure service reported illness (identified using diagnosis code). If expected procedure code doesn’t match a billed procedure code, insurance companies tag claim a potential fraud claim. Once a claim tagged a fraud claim, manual examiner needs additional verification ensure claim submitted fraud provider.
 Sometimes, patients’ fake identity get benefit insurance. Using big data, companies match patients’ information services he/she taken. If services taken patient different past medical history patients, analytics tag claim susceptible fraud claims.
 Storing data:
 Traditional health care providers find difficult store a vast amount data. More ever, traditional database stores structured data. Big data solve storage issue handling huge volume variety data. Having historical data patient reduce healthcare drastically.
 Improving scheduling appointments:
 It tough get a Physician’s appointment developed countries. One friends, senior director a multinational bank, got appointment hip replacement surgery a waiting period months. He able sit a result, didn’t drive come office months. The waiting period drastically reduced hospital able forecast number patients likely miss appointments. Based historical data, hospitals predict number shows accordingly schedule appointments miss slot shows.
 Reducing overpayment underpayment made hospital:
 If a health insurance company pays amount hospital/provider greater contracted amount service, payment called overpayment. Similarly, payment made lesser contracted amount service, payment called underpayment. Overpayment underpayment a big headache insurance companies patients. According AHA data, private insurance companies consistently overpaid hospitals inpatient care decades. These overpayments varied significantly years, grown dramatically past years.
 Overpayment underpayment happen multiple reasons system glitch, a coding error. Using cognitive analysis, big data predict payment amount. If predicted payment amount significantly different actual payment amount, system identify possible overpayments underpayments.
 Predictive treatment:
 Throughout world, healthcare based diagnosing presence disease subsequently treating disease present. Early diagnosis illness a major challenge. Patients go diagnosis symptom evident.  It becomes challenging physician treat illness illness grows beyond a certain level.
 Predictive preventive help identify individual develop a disease. Different forms health device iWatch capture data send hospital regular interval time. Using predictive analysis, hospital predict a patient likely develop illness. Early diagnosis illness help doctors treat patients effectively a lower cost.
 Predictive treatment reduce number days a patient needs admitted hospital. As inpatient treatment costlier outpatient treatment, doctors discharge patients he/she thinks condition patient serious. The hospital monitor patient remotely using medical sensors call patient hospital required.
 Big data plays a big role a person suffers multiple illnesses. As per Dr. Abhishek Rai, M.S. Ortho K.E.M. Medical College Mumbai, “It becomes challenging operate patients suffers multiple illnesses. Many a number times, physicians aware issues patients patients aware illness”. As example, it’s tough operate a person suffering diabetes blood doesn’t coat easily a diabetic person.  If a physician doesn’t historical data a diabetic person, he/she operate diabetic person wrongly.
 Another example big data analytics play a huge role predicting disease a genetic disease. If a person breast cancer, child 15-20 percent likely develop breast cancer. Using big data analytics, system identify patients likely suffer genetic disease request patients timely screening. Genetic diseases screened first, second- third-degree relatives reduce morbidity mortality. 
 Timely diagnostic reports:
 In India, takes 2-3 days average get MRI scan. Delay lack medical instruments lack qualified radiologists. This problem mitigated integrating Medical imaging big data. Integration medical imaging big data ensure radiologists get report a short span time. Big data help reduce turnaround time required get reports also get better reports. Technology convert image graphs charts making easier radiologists read report.
 As data works principle abundance instead scarcity. So, data have, better outcomes obtained. Thus, Big Data technology clearly digital disruptor revolutionize healthcare sector consolidating data disparate platforms build a 360-degree view human body help healthcare provider generate solutions life-threatening problems improved healthcare opportunities.
