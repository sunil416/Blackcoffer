 The number seem small, closely a look daily cases reported, situation seems alarming growth looking exponential now.
 The number cases doubt going increase future, hard predict right now. But curve expected flatter case India, lesson learnt mistakes countries like Italy a nation kept a lockdown.
 This a necessary step, doubt, raised problems already slowdown hit country.
 The Federation Indian Chambers Commerce Industry (Ficci) said: “A significant 53 percent Indian businesses indicate marked impact coronavirus pandemic business operations even early stages.” The tourism travel industry hit whose operations almost come zero. The hit sector manufacturing, a significant portion unorganized sector employed there, situation worsens. Healthcare hygiene products like mouth masks, sanitizers, handwash become expensive due excessive demand.
 With present ongoing situation, followings things predicted:
 The Medicines Healthcare costs expected increase future India imports 69% raw material pharmaceutical drugs, due lockdown countries, supply route fragmented drastically. This also evident recent increase common use medicines like Paracetamol, whose cost gone 40% per latest CRISIL report.
 Industries depending cheap labor could take a hit pandemics prone populated countries, factory workers unorganized sectors don’t access healthcare benefits, cases might shoot drastically, attendance future go rate inversely.
 Smartphones electronics sales affected directly. In china sale smartphones expected go 50%, stores lockdown a long time, launch events getting postponed canceled, since China largest smartphone manufacturer world, 1 every 4 smartphones shipped China, affect us too. Similar case electronics, whose parts even whole units cases manufactured China. So prices might rise future, maybe immediately, last quarter financial year.
 Lack technology incur a greater logistic cost containing coronavirus outbreaks case India. China technology giant, took help technology track contain coronavirus outbreak, case 80% transactions hand, cost risk containing virus high.
 The meat prices dropping drastically due stigma losses reaching 1100 crores. This issue serious concern a country like India whose meat industry 90% governed unorganized sector.
 The sectors going get serious hit are- Airlines, Tourism & Travel, Cruise, Share market, Leisure & Hospitality, Automobiles, Product manufacturers due negative sentiments fear minds common people.
 The sectors need prove are- Banking, Education, Healthcare Manufacturing. A lot depend react future.
 The Indian economy could react corona crisis 3 ways:
 V-shaped: This “classic” real economy shock, output get displaced, growth eventually recovers. In scenario, annual growth rates could fully absorb shock. This case Canada post-2008 crisis Canada maintained credit flow capital formation.
  U-shaped: This scenario worse V— shock persists, even though initial growth resumed permanent loss output. This case USA post-2008 crisis. This led a deep banking crisis disturbed credit supply. 
 L-Shaped: This scenario worst all. Not growth rate declines, economy never recovers. The distance previous path keeps widening increased loss output, leaving lasting structural damage economy.
 With recent cut India’s growth projections Moody’s Fitch, future indicates a deeper slowdown, recession. To come pandemic cleanly lesser shocks, government needs set priorities right- prime focus right medical healthcare sector country battling against coronavirus, along that, government try take along lower sections society providing monetary gains battling daily necessities along virus. In long term, government keep eye issue liquidity keep cycle going.
 But this, a responsible citizen understand duties responsibilities towards country society try take country outbreak part.
