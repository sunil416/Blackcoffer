 There AIaaS platforms DataRobot, Petuum, H2O shows field expanding.AI probably make human workers obsolete, least a long time To put fears bed: robots probably coming jobs, least yet. Given artificial intelligence portrayed media, particular favorite sci-fi movies, it’s clear advent technology created fear AI day make human beings obsolete workforce. After all, technology advanced, tasks executed human hands become automated. It’s natural fear leap toward creating intelligent computers could herald beginning end work know it. But, don’t think reason fatalistic. A recent paper published MIT Task Force Work Future entitled “Artificial Intelligence And The Future Work,” looked closely developments AI relation world work. The paper paints a optimistic picture.
 Rather promoting obsolescence human labor, paper predicts AI continue drive massive innovation fuel existing industries could potential create sectors growth, ultimately leading creation jobs. While AI made major strides toward replicating efficacy human intelligence executing certain tasks, major limitations. In particular, AI programs typically capable “specialized” intelligence, meaning solve problem, execute task a time. Often, rigid, unable respond changes input, perform “thinking” outside prescribed programming. Humans, however, possess “generalized intelligence,” kind problem-solving, abstract thinking, critical judgment continue important business. Human judgment relevant, every task, certainly throughout every level across sectors. There factors could limit runaway advancement AI. AI often requires “learning” involve massive amounts data, calling question availability right kind data, highlighting need categorization issues privacy security around data. There also limitation computation processing power. The cost electricity alone power supercharged language model AI estimated $4.6 million. Another important limitation note data carry bias, reflective societal inequities implicit biases designers create input data. If bias data inputted AI, bias likely carry results generated AI.
 There even a bill introduced Congress entitled Algorithmic Accountability Act goal forcing Federal Trade Commission investigate use AI technology potential perpetuate bias. Based factors others, MIT CCI paper argues a long reaching a point AI comparable human intelligence, could theoretically replace human workers entirely.  Provided investment levels, education private sector governmental organizations—anywhere focuses training upskilling workers—AI potential ultimately create jobs, less. The question become “humans computers” “humans computers” involved complex systems advance industry prosperity. This paper a fascinating read anyone hoping dive deeper AI potential directions lead.AI Is becoming standard businesses, world tech A couple times recently, AI come conversation a client associate, I’m noticing a fallacy people thinking it. There seems a sense a phenomenon likely big impacts tech world. In case hadn’t noticed, tech world world days. Don’t ever forget economist Paul Krugman said 1998 “By 2005 so, become clear Internet’s impact economy greater fax machine’s.” You definitely don’t want behind curve comes AI.  In fact, 90% leading businesses already ongoing investments AI technologies. More half businesses implemented manner AI-driven technology report experiencing greater productivity. AI likely a strong impact certain sectors particular:
 Medical:
 The potential benefits utilizing AI field medicine already explored. The medical industry a robust amount data, utilized create predictive models related healthcare. Additionally, AI shown effective physicians certain diagnostic contexts.
 Automotive:
 We’re already seeing AI impacting world transportation automobiles advent autonomous vehicles autonomous navigation. AI also a major impact manufacturing, including within automotive sector.
 Cybersecurity:
 Cybersecurity front mind business leaders, especially considering spike cybersecurity breaches throughout 2020. Attacks rose 600% pandemic hackers capitalized people working home, less secure technological systems, Wi-Fi networks. AI machine learning critical tools identifying predicting threats cybersecurity. AI also a crucial asset security world finance, given process large amounts data predict catch instances fraud.
 E-Commerce:
 AI play a pivotal role e-commerce future, every sector industry user experience marketing fulfillment distribution. We expect moving forward, AI continue drive e-commerce, including use chat-bots, shopper personalization, image-based targeting advertising, warehouse inventory automation.
 AI a big impact job search
 If moving forward hope a hiring manager give benefit doubt a small misstep within application, might a rude awakening. AI already plays a major role hiring process, much 75% resumes rejected automated applicant tracking system, ATS even reach a human being.  In past, recruiters devote considerable time poring resumes look relevant candidates. Data LinkedIn shows recruiters spend 23 hours looking resumes successful hire.
 Increasingly, however, resume scanning done AI-powered programs. In 2018, 67% hiring managers stated AI making jobs easier. Despite increasing prevalence automation algorithms hiring process, critical use certain types AI hiring managers, based charge perpetuate ever create bias hiring. One particular example illustrated HireVue, a startup whose initial services included technology aimed use facial recognition software psychology determine potential effectiveness a candidate a certain role. The Electronic Privacy Information Center filed a lawsuit Federal Trade Commission alleging software potential perpetuate bias prejudice. HireVue discontinued use facial recognition software early 2021, uses audio analysis natural language processing. It’s clear use certain types AI hiring process likely controversial technology develops. However, potential employers using AI process application, reason cannot utilizing similar technology advantage.
 Jobscan excellent resource provides similar resume scanning would used a hiring manager. By comparing resume a job description, Jobscan give information tweak resume a good match a certain position, goal “beating” applicant tracking system (ATS).
 Jobseer a browser add-on, another great AI-based tool job market. Based a scan resume, well keywords skills related desired jobs, Jobseer help match job listings fit experience. For listing, get a rating based well aligned particular posting, well recommendations skills add better position resume experience.
 Rezi: Now, a disclaimer, would never encourage turn resume writing a bot. But Rezi awesome AI-based resume builder includes templates help design a resume sure check boxes comes applicant tracking systems. This a great jumping-off point kickstart a resume.  Another great use type tool generate a resume compare current resume stacks up, identify areas improvement. AI also a great place focus energy looking upskill career, make professional profile competitive job market, especially consider AI far-reaching impacts across industries.AI machine learning top lists important skills today’s job market. Jobs requesting AI machine-learning skills expected increase 71% next years. If you’d like expand knowledge base arena, consider great free online course offerings focus AI skills. If tech-savvy, would wise dive deep learn much interacting AI space. If skills lie elsewhere, important recognize AI a big impact, extent abilities, try understand fundamentals functions different sectors. AI definitely stay, whether like not. Personally, don’t think anything afraid of. The move forward aware adapt technology around us, AI included. This article updated April 16, 2021, reflect changes HireVue’s assessment tools.
