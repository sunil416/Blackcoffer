 Human minds, a fascination carrying potential tinkering nature pixie dust intelligence, creating solving mysteries wonders anything admiration. However, matter captivating a human mind be, could sometimes appalled. It could hunger maybe desire want more, go beyond unravel limitations, maybe something like pure greed. Humans never stopped always keep evolving comes intelligence makes supreme.
 Intelligence calls supremacy so, evolve something opposed a challenge human minds, capabilities making question importance themselves? Artificial Intelligence came a revolution, havoc came light. The concept making machines work own, like granting machines –The Intelligence.
 The idea making machines work like humans came back 19s. Back people didn’t believe a thing making a non-living thing work, think, carry tasks own, mention, actually surpass humans skills. The facts did. By 1997. The greatest chess player, Garry Kasparov defeated a chess game a machine exactly, a top skilled human lost a mere machine created another could’ve never defeated him. It a rule power, betterment, skills, granted supremacy. Were AI Machines tools? Equipment?  Something helped unskilled person mind intelligence creates something could skilled work perfection precision? Well initially was, however, time passed humans got drawn puzzle AI, a lot changed. Human research went deeper deeper a result, machines evolved it.
 At present, AI & Machines a growing field. As develops improves, become a part industrial revolution. In industries, laborious work taken care humans replaced machines. Naturally, evolution machines, precision, mass productivity, quality control, time efficiencies, factors made a better choice. A choice humans.
 This led fear, a fear a not-so-distant future, a future maybe machines evolved they’ll take need a human employee leading unemployment. With population increase around world, became tech threat labor market. Then again… true it? Does AI really oppose a threat? Will adapting technology make millions people lose jobs? Will lead mass unemployment? Will machines really surpass humans? Will, creation take creator?
 No matter fearful future AI seem, reality, scary. Truth AI present reality, key holds power unlock a whole next level human evolution. Technology growing. There a time technology idea, today idea implemented, it’s working carried out. Nobody could stop advancement growth Artificial Intelligence, it’s a wave already flowing present generation generations come learn, learn swim flow avoid drowning.
 Many jobs replaced machines, AI evolves it’ll keep challenging human minds skills. With present COVID 19 situation, contactless cashiers robots delivering packages already taken usual routine tasks. The jobs Secretaries, Schedulers, book-keeper risk too. Manufacturing units, agriculture, food services, retail, transportation & logistic, hospitality a part AI-affected automation. At estimation, said around 20 million jobs, especially including manufacturing lost robots. As AI, robotics, 3D printing, genetics make in, even architects, medical docs, music composers feel threatened technology. Making us question AI even edge us brain jobs too? Now terrifying.
 However, much machines replacing jobs, they’ll also creating jobs.  With economic growth, innovation, investment around 133 million jobs said generated. These newly enhanced jobs create benefits amplify one’s creativity, strategy, entrepreneurial skills. So catch?
 Well, it’s skills. Even though AI creating 3 times jobs destroying, it’s skills count. AI surged job opportunities, opportunities like Senior Data Scientist, Mobile Application Developer, SEO specialist. These jobs never heard AI it’s born, however, jobs qualification, needs high-level skills acquire skills expensive time-consuming task. The future generation might able cope real struggle faced present generations. It’s vulnerability skill gap unemployment youths ones crushed most.
 Therefore, advancement AI becomes inevitable remains choice adapt, learn, equip grow it. The companies work together build AI-ready workplace. They collaborate government, educators, non-profit organizations work together bring policies could help understand technologies’ impacts faster also providing employees security. The economic business planning made considerable minimizing impact local jobs properly maximizing opportunities.
 The employees provided proper tools carry along opportunities acquiring AI-based skills day-to-day work. New skills identified implemented upskilling continual learning initiatives. Employees maximize Robotic Quotient learn core skills. They’ll adapt working models understand roles coming future. 
 Howsoever, it’s like AI totally take control, even though AI proves a better choice, limitations present. First, it’s expensive, secondly, manufacturing machines bulk good environment. Machines also high maintenance, therefore human labor often come cheaper considered machines. Underdeveloped countries find hard equip people upskilling reskilling required AI workplace AI play a role countries, might take years. AI also risky unethical, it’s hard figure held responsible cases AI went wrong.
 No matter, advanced AI gets, skills humans always upper hand i.e., soft skills. Skills like teamwork, communication, creativity, critical thinking something AI hasn’t able beat us yet value creativity, leadership, emotional intelligence increased. Although, machines coming humans causing lack human-to-human interaction, humans seem fade away a little.
 With era, comes need good leaders. Leaders capable handling machines humans together, ones organized enough manage skilled unskilled employees providing unskilled trainees proper training. Leaders hold profound soft skills encourage teamwork working along machines. The ones patient, calm, optimized.  
 In conclusion, yes AI machines going challenging there’s nothing humans haven’t overcome. Adaptation up-gradation going primary factor survival. As witness onset 4th industrial revolution, let’s buckle seats race along highway essential fuels (skills) let eliminated. After all, unending race infinity end, could try run fuel. Try outdated.
