 Before jumping pros cons industrial revolution 4.0, important understand industrial revolution 4.0. Industrial Revolution 4.0: Industrial revolution 4.0 term used describe transition electronic-based industry dominated fusion emerging fields ideas like Artificial Intelligence, robotics, green energy, etc.
  ‘Industry 4.0’, era digitalization. The term originated Hanover Messe 2011 incorporated German high-tech strategy. Much attributed Klaus Schwab, a German engineer founded World Economic Forum. Two years later, Industry 4.0 Platform (central network digital transformation) set make work. It characterized 4 physical digital trends: 1 Autonomous motor vehicles (cars, trucks, drones, aircraft, water vessels); 2 3D printing (medical implants); 3 Advanced robotics (Agri health care); 4 New materials (graphene).

 Pros cons industrial revolution 4.0
 PROS CONS
 Industry 4.0 helps us improve operational performance efficiency. With minimum machine downtimes, produce faster allocating resources cost-effectively efficiently. Data security issues main concerns manufacturers believe investing smart factories increase risk security breaches chance proprietary production knowledge theft.
 Since production processes automated, high-quality standards maintained a lower manufacturing cost. Technical glitches loss high-paying jobs resistance stakeholders invest technologies entry-level barriers towards industry 4.0.
 It also enhance flexibility, speed market, agility launching products services. It easier scale production a smart factory minimum modifications. Social issues impact society a notable cons. Earlier industrial revolutions went made Huge changes social terms. There a lot urbanization industrialization. There uncertainty things shape now. 
 Industry 4.0 presents opportunity improve customer experience service reducing resolution time, fewer defects, offers product choices customers. Interoperability, information transparency, automation, integration production process a critical changes lying ahead existing manufacturers.
 It makes compliance easier – complying regulations industries like pharmaceutical medical device manufacturing a manual process. Instead, industry 4.0 technologies make possible automate compliance including track trace, quality inspections, serialization, data logging, etc. Skill education training manpower need improved takes a good chunk investment.
