 In future upcoming years humans machines going work together every field work. In upcoming days machines need every human being. Machines [AI technology] work humans incapable doing. Machines partner co-operate humans.
 According professor university Washington, explained that, a result AI, demand existing jobs jobs created unimaginable today. Human workers machines work together flawlessly, complementing other. Machines learn carry easier tasks following processes crunching data. They also help humans difficult. Machines AI create a great job opportunities humans future. John Kelly ll, executive vice president IBM said “Man Machines working together always beat make a better decision a man a machine independently.”
  In future, sectors country like agriculture sector, industrial sector service sector going utilize machines. So, work becomes difficult. As now, agriculture purposes various kinds machines used called a modern farming method. Some major technologies [machines] harvest automation, autonomous tractors, seeding, weeing drones. As a result, farms agriculture peacefully. In industrial sector also humans machines working together increase production. Various types machines used industries packing machines, loading machine etc. humans provide instructions machines maintain management company. Soon robots [machines] assist doctors surgeries. For instance, a doctor remote location could direct a surgical robot perform open heart surgery. But approaches option decision left experience wisdom doctor robot.
 What think machines make humans less field? Machines push human professionals skillset ladder uniquely human skills creativity, social abilities, empathy, sense-making, machines cannot automate. As a result, machines make workplace more, less humans. However, humans learn skills throughout lives. It said future 80% process-oriented tasks done machines. Quantitative reasoning tasks done approximately 50% humans 50% machines, humans continue 80% cross-functional reasoning tasks. According Harvard research machines, algorithms read diagnostic scans 92% accuracy. Humans 96% accuracy. Together, 99% accurate.
 Human-machine collaboration enables companies interact employees customers novel, effective ways. Smart machines helping humans expand abilities ways. They amplify cognitive strengths; interact customers employees free us higher-level tasks, embody human skills extend physical capabilities. In research, found 1,500 companies achieve significant performance improvement humans machines work together. New machine systems beyond-human cognitive abilities, us fear could potentially dehumanize future work. Machines indeed automate repetitive physical tasks, part quantitative tasks programming even data science. According D.E Shaw Group professor University Washington, explained that, a result machines, demand existing jobs, jobs created unimaginable today. This similar couldn’t imagine a web app developer decades ago, millions make a living today.
 Machines good tasks speed, precision, accuracy. But machines good responding unknown situations making judgments. That part left humans. Hence, need humans machines future. Humans machines divergent skill sets that, combined transform work. Machines already infiltrated every aspect lives, must learn live them. In future, human workers interact closely humans.
