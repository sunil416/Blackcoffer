 Artificial intelligence (AI) intelligence demonstrated machines, opposed natural intelligence displayed humans animals. Leading AI textbooks define field study “intelligent agents”: system perceives environment takes actions maximize chance achieving goals.
 AI applications include advanced web search engines, recommendation systems (used YouTube, Amazon, Netflix), understanding human speech (such Siri Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g. Tesla), competing highest level strategic game systems (such chess Go). As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered require “intelligence” often removed definition AI, a phenomenon known AI effect. But said everything comes a price, case AI. It advantages time, disadvantages. And prominent ones USE AI WARS.
 Artificial intelligence isn’t a consumer business-centric technology. Yes, companies use AI automate various tasks, consumers use AI make daily routines easier. But governments–and particular militaries–also a massive interest speed scale offered AI. Nation-states already using artificial intelligence monitor boundaries defenses. Militaries research development artificial intelligence (AI), looking implement AI systems. In early August year, U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency announced later month a human fighter pilot would face against AI algorithm virtual combat. The leading military powers already made clear want profit opportunities offered promising technology.
 Many nations like U.S.A, U.K, China already started investing AI military.
 If nations keep investing military funds AI military development consequences devastating lead elimination entire human species. The usage robots never tiring non demanding wars fatal. During war times difficulties faced shortage food, weapons, human resources, tiredness soldiers. But AI solves all. The machines don’t need food, never tired loss human lives also prevented.
 If AI introduced wars wars become ever-ending. The powerful nations try suppress weak ones. The wars never end. The huge impact wars destroy human civilization.
 Even though AI a revolutionary step research industry devastating steps far seen.
 If AI introduced futuristic wars, wars unimaginable. Robotic armies humanoids used wars will. The robotic armies invade territories like wild creatures leaving mercy anyone. This lead devastation destruction. As years ago Hiroshima Nagasaki, nuclear blasts caused havoc similar havoc caused use AI militaries wars consequences far worse worse human civilization’s elimination Earth. Or consequences worse taking example establishment robotic territories start destroying humans want slaves.
 We make assumptions. None us seen future.
