 Why a severe immunological inflammatory explosion affected arms covid-19? genetic causes related immune response il6 macrophages, would types scenarios related environmental element?
 il-6 a marker macrophages, essential pre-inflammatory marker, question directed already known factor, asking reason a brutal response immune system.
 For example, Spain parallel treatments administration corticosteroids anti-inflammatory drugs.
 And another worrying markers patients increase ferritin, values range.
 The exacerbated response immune system, specifically il-6, addition pre-inflammatory, also anti-inflammatory function, depending synergies occur types receptors. R-il-6 gp 130 acts antagonist, types proteins typical endothelial cells macrophages.
 But question severe call il-6 il-1 affected covid-19.
 Could virus’s nexus protein synergy R-il-6 binding case, acting agonist,? act, making a call effect. don’t know.
 My question directed him, why? abrupt exaggerated call. And a short time.
 Could virus replication speed vs. slower activation speed T B lymphocytes?
 In innate immunity, Monocytes case macrophages cells present il-6 cell membranes, a large amount … response.
 It immune response associated cellular damage (DAMP). Why?
 Even soluble peptides like cathelicidins HDPs react produced cells epithelial tissue respiratory, digestive system skin itself, pro- anti-inflammatory. also act chemoattraction agents, pro-apoptosis case epithelial cells anti-apoptotic case neutrophils, barrier innate immune system, yes, extent producing inflammation severe, cell death a short time?
