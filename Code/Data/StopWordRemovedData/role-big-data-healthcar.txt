 Challenges
 There currently explosion electronic clinical data, analyzed glean insights improve overall health healthcare.
 Two data quality issues systematic data inaccuracies data fragmentation need addressed order ensure insight electronic clinical data valid.
 These issues require specific attention policymakers practitioners lessened promoting greater interoperability reducing burdensome documentation requirements.
 There enormous enthusiasm “big data” address persistent cost quality deficiencies healthcare system. The notion simply analyzing massive amount clinical information newly available digital format enable groundbreaking insights:
 Earlier detection effective treatments
 Better targeted clinical decision support
 Real-time biosurveillance
 Accurate predictions likely get sick.
 Will Transforming Healthcare Deliver Its Promises?
 It take harnessing data create Institute Medicine calls a “learning health system” healthcare continuously identify adopt approaches deliver better care lower costs. Big data generated even excitement since recent election, analysts able use vast amounts disparate data polls, economic indicators, historical trends predict election outcomes astounding accuracy. Yet, excitement big data analytics requires appears gotten ahead reality. Without specific attention challenges, important tool transforming healthcare fail deliver promise.
 Healthcare Data Are Big But Are They Good?
 The set challenges confront big data efforts. Healthcare needs continual technical advances store efficiently access rapidly expanding amount data. There also challenges particularly salient healthcare. The challenge demands significantly attention ensuring data big good.
 Healthcare a problem big. The rate electronic health record adoption continues climb inpatient ambulatory settings. Health record adoption used a large scale capture clinical care hospitals, outpatient visits, countless pharmacies, laboratories, sites. And increasingly, patients using devices track health health-related behaviors generate substantial data. The Healthcare space achieved big exponential growth ahead.
 Healthcare Data Quality
 The problem healthcare lies quality data. To derive insights data, critical accurate relatively complete. When data systematically biased either errors omissions, correlations give rise insights missed spurious, could result misguided confidence scarce resources dedicated chasing dead ends.
 Healthcare disproportionately concerned data quality 2 reasons. First, a large fraction data entered humans, intentionally unintentionally introduce systematic errors. In domains, data a natural byproduct healthcare increasing reliance technology. Internet searches, online purchases, cell phone calls create a treasure trove data mined patterns (eg, flu symptom searches) used experimentation (do buy “cart” upper right upper left?). The opportunities data error relatively limited easily identified algorithms.
 Hard Way Solve Healthcare Data Quality Issue
 In healthcare, critical clinical data symptoms, physical signs, orders, progress notes rely heavily human entry foreseeable future. Beyond simple data entry errors, bigger, systemic problems clinical data electronic format. Current reimbursement policies require extensive documentation clinicians often respond using templates automatically populate large quantities data using copy-paste features propagate mistakes outdated information.
 Further, physician documentation styles vary substantially, making errors omissions difficult identify. For instance, a patient empty medication list, patient taking medications, patient informed physician a medication taking, physician chosen document medications elsewhere? Systematic data inaccuracies quick fixes. The helpful, long-term solution would payers, especially Medicare, relax documentation requirements providers focus data entry clinical, billing, needs.
 Technical Solutions Healthcare Data Quality Issue
 Alternatively, promising technical solutions machine learning, a form artificial intelligence trains systems make predictions certain characteristics data. While machine learning proved successful identifying missing diagnoses, limited use critical clinical data like symptoms physical exam findings. In addition, richest source clinical data, clinicians’ notes, remains largely beyond reach big data. There substantial improvements natural language processing (NLP) identify key information clinical notes. However, quality notes improves, hard NLP programs glean important information. Continued investment technical solutions undoubtedly improve data accuracy, without fundamental changes care documented, healthcare circumspect healthcare ability rid data systematic errors.
 Data Fragmentation Healthcare
 Even healthcare achieves perfect data accuracy, a daunting challenge remains data fragmentation. Incomplete data common clinical practice reflect healthcare space highly fragmented healthcare system patients multiple clinicians whose electronic health record communicate. Despite significant policy interest, healthcare yet achieve meaningful level interoperability without it, creating a comprehensive picture patients’ care nearly impossible. Incomplete data, like inaccurate data, also lead missed spurious associations wasteful even harmful patient care.
 The solutions addressing fragmented data easier address inaccurate data. Achieving greater interoperability electronic clinical systems pursued policymakers nearly 2 decades success. While policymakers recently renewed efforts, primary focus, moving specific pieces clinical information (such a laboratory test result) individual healthcare providers, ensure provider organization a comprehensive picture patient’s care across care sites. Many patients privacy advocates understandably concerned efforts aggregate data. However, adequate de-identification security safeguards, risks aggregation minimized benefits better care lower costs substantial.
 Conclusion
 The potential big data healthcare enormous exciting. It hard find a delivery system thinking leverage electronic health record data, researchers eager answer types questions. Realizing healthcare’s large national investment health demands healthcare space learns newly available data. Doing requires healthcare understand issues data quality address effectively. The solutions easy. However, ignoring challenges could quickly lead healthcare hope big data disappointing wasteful results bad data.
