 AI experts believe it’s going main drivers fourth Industrial Revolution potential transform tech sectors going open a chapter society world people try understand better rather outside world AI people naysayer kind try drum doomsday scenarios pretty irresponsible. After all, In next, ten years AI going deliver improvements quality lives a renaissance, a golden age machine- learning artificial intelligence realm science fiction last several decades. AI probably important thing humanities ever worked profound work technology, important harness benefits minimizing downside focusing autonomous systems like self-driving cars seen mother AI projects made applications like self-driving technology viable time, things happen time number data collection data processing became easier better technologies right um need data fuel AI training that’s big drivers thing happened computer processing become faster that’s like engine matter much fuel don’t engine processing data a timeframe that’s reasonable possible thing that’s happened algorithms developed made AI much powerful #technology changing developing a pace that’s much faster ever used rapid pace change means used thinking it’s going impact immediate future. The important factor responsible growth AI Google AI Google’s done given us power get relevant information want fingertips created a shift things bought didn’t happen overnight started 2004 major change happens start 2012 onwards Google’s taken away 65% sales people’s jobs primarily order takers ones remaining likely gone next decade.
 In present several AI projects helping diagnosing diseases better match drugs people depending they’re sick get treated better it’s going help a whole lot people get treated get better #healthcare would access look self-driving cars they’re going safer people driving cars value machine learning providing actually happening beneath surface things like improved search results improved product recommendations customers improve forecasting inventory management literally hundreds things including speech-recognition image-recognition performance levels phenomenal  drug discovery biological systems complicated vaccines TB HIV developing that’s notably enabled rich data advanced biology machine learning recent invention application launched anybody visual impairment ass uses latest cutting-edge computer vision technology give anyone ability see, anyone dyslexia use AI able read better  latest release Windows 10 capability called IJ’s enable eye muscle gaze help type. Like sides coin, negative impacts AI well  Bill Gates Ellen Musk also tech giants a views pessimistic, say least, warned against potential AI replace humans workplace Ella masks even went far claim AI biggest existential threat mankind. loss a job, think a job a career choice a majority tasks comprise career choice likely vulnerable tasks a career risk future tasks AI find? hard anything unpredictable anything requires skills like creative thinking empathy interpersonal skills it’s important understand tomorrow whether Google not, artificial intelligence going progress know technology nature it’s it’s going evolve  technology particular AI can, fact, bring empowerment inclusiveness time important clear-eyed displacement unintended consequences like technology work skills people find jobs future create jobs also policy decisions help people go change people already unhappy machine learning artificial intelligence think  they’re innovative enough creative enough job taking away a lot machines AI business going affect future work specifically jobs risk taken AI automation wide dissonance this, different reports shared  Oxford study says 47% US jobs risk automation next years meanwhile general population workers think differently a recent study conducted college actually identifies 97% workers believe jobs automated suggests general public needs educated jobs  susceptible risk businesses need aware forthcoming skills gap course jobs equal Oxford study highlights examined 700 participants found generalist occupations require creative knowledge innovation least risk true occupations education healthcare media arts jobs flip side jobs like telemarketers junior lawyers accountants risk short a simple rule thumb job predictable routine risk automation much higher a job doesn’t require innovation creativity return investment companies higher machines real-time employees machines faster can’t distracted work 24/7 actually good creative marketers AI automation serve augment jobs rather substituting impact emerging technologies creative economy stated artificial intelligence changing  creative content beginning end 2030 AI able write high school essays code Python composed top 40s chart songs make creative videos advancements also come risks costs take a look report global Commission future work absence effective transition policies people accept lower skilled lower paying jobs high-skilled workers taking less cognitively demanding jobs displacing less educated workers already happening also technological dividends unevenly distributed firms a limited amount companies tend dominate comes big data think Google Facebook today alone responsible 70% referral marketing traffic  receive 50% total global advertising budget question businesses workers social institutions go direction companies public policy leaders understand evolving landscape help workforce anticipate upcoming challenges technology demographic changes leading a smaller workforce compared previous generation a workforce pursue careers time work need provide workers environment continuously upskill grow governments re-evaluate educational system continuously learn grow companies redesign structure culture around technology like Industrial Revolution heading a age great transformation we’re 2022 estimated 20 25 percent labor force displaced within 10 20 years however also opportunity people get ahead different ways find attract retain highly skilled workers allow time skill even work hours a  good  develop a learning community benefit also use technology supplement goal tracking  efforts instead a distraction short  bridge dissonance imperative build a  map AI automation affect  industry  company economic imperative people feel committing a lifelong approach knowledge  risks important important things like upfront ethical charters like AI safety transparent open perceive progress figure global frameworks engage like Paris agreement climate change using  forums bring people together engage hard questions emerge answers question whether AI a threat not, artificial intelligence  a threat a rare case people need proactive regulation instead reactive think time reactive AI regulation it’s late right machine learning algorithms solve incredibly complex problem beyond human intelligence  mere machines given enormous data set come brilliant correlations insights they’re going threaten human population anytime fish intelligent isn’t terrible human a smart enough learn skills least a complete toolbox prepared volatility future adaptability.
