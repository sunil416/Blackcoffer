 As Coronavirus pandemic unfolds, industries face problems never imagined prepared for. The Aviation Tourism industries face highest stress Coronavirus spreads a (usually) a leisure spending also nature disease directly conflicts industries’ innate business models. In article, look impact COVID-19 pandemic Tourism Aviation industries demand side supply side.
 The Aviation Tourism industries major customers: tourists business travellers. Let us base essay India reaction customer segments expected like.
 Almost tourists avoid vacationing foreseeable future of:
 Financial hardship: exceptionally large part world’s working population affected financially pandemic. Unemployment rates soaring ones a job facing pay-cuts, furloughs deferment salaries.
 Risk contraction: disease spreads social contact, safe vacation destination regularly sanitized crowded. Inherently, tourist destinations compliant regulations even industry makes a change clean introducing social distancing measures, convincing risk averse tourists travel vacation spots difficult.
 Expansion alternatives ways relax: people adapt work-from-home environments, burnout rate declining. People relaxed homes people eagerly looking a getaway. Combined deterrent rise alternative ways relax. More people going walks, yoga finding hobbies. Due increase pursuit happiness home, might likely tourists avoid traveling don’t feel urge break-free move away a holiday.
 Now, let us look different types holiday revellers. Tourists foreigners domestic tourists. According Business Insider “In 2019, almost 10 million foreign tourists visited India — spending ₹1,800 billion January November period.”. However, pandemic, almost business lost.
 Due reasons stated foreigners prefer travel. Those dare venture out, perhaps wooed discounted deals places would otherwise budgets, possibly warded following factors:
 Poor quality health care India: chance a tourist contracts COVID-19, probably accustomed a better healthcare system India provides. Being a developing country India find hard convince foreign tourists healthcare systems mark home countries.
 Densely populated regions around tourist destinations: tourist destinations support a neighbouring economy, areas often densely populated, leads a higher risk transmission COVID-19 foreign tourists cognizant fact.
 Moving focus domestic tourists, subdivide population according income levels:
 Below Poverty Line: people don’t travel

Because industry a leisure expense, manufacturing supporting equipment like adventure sports gears even parts planes stopped. Because drop demand, going tough get supply chain back again. Furthermore, workers afraid show jobs high risk contracting virus due exposure multiple customers different geographies.
 Let us examples industry done March April.
 Airbnbs (in America):
 The bookings vanished mid-March. Property owners bought leased real estate list app severely affected. The sharing economy, like Uber, Lyft DoorDash taken a hit Airbnb worse expenses include cleaning services, interior design (one-time spend), property maintenance fixed costs.
 Thus, pandemic revenue gone costs exist. They people depend owner’s rental income made problem worse.
 Hosts usually decide cancellation policy, extreme circumstances, like one, company decided override existing policies (many weren’t strict) gave full refund guests. The company got $2 billion loan helped owners, financially paying 25% cancelled bookings capping 5k/host. They helped hosts getting eligible small business loans avoid eviction.
 Thankfully, properties cause a housing crisis, breakdown could cause strain lenders undermine property values (all want sell avoid foreclosure defaulting loans). AirDNA states listing split-up Airbnb is: 33% list single property, 33% owners list 2-24 properties, 33% hosts 25+ properties.
 Some state governments America banned short-term rentals. This hurt Airbnb owners people looking quarantine outside homes near relatives could’ve generated revenues.
 So, hosts now?
 Many discounting units looking long-term tenants (12 months). Many planning apply a small-business loan, seek forbearance banks, find long-term tenants independently Airbnb sell property.
 Reluctance workers comeback work (America):

 This complicates reopening workers don’t want come back expose virus earn less. But businesses want workers come back small business loans forgiven, business reopen. However, money consumer’s pockets means economy expected rebound quickly businesses open. About 40 million Americans unemployment benefits, majorly restaurant, hospitality, retail industries.
 Congress chose a flat amount relief really time-consuming payments calibrated worker’s lost wages. Their $600 federal payment corresponds $15/hours wage, 21 states follow $7.25/hours.
 Most workers don’t want sit home anxious get back work, right staying home smartest financial decision families.
 Workers ineligible unemployment benefits a job made available them. But owners reluctant report workers authorities sever relationships employees need later year tourism demand expected pick up. Without income support, low-wage workers would likely seek jobs, including side hustles gig work, could expose households virus. Thus, according government, important give a large stimulus economy.
 Coronavirus planes:
 Studies SARs suggested people sitting close infectious persons large risk. Combined that, long journeys, passengers take masks. Thus, risks transmission large airlines need focus figuring prevent transmission planes.
 Currently, airlines plan using self-cleaning material, long-lasting disinfectant, touchless lavatories, UV light a disinfectant, antimicrobial coating frequently touched surfaces, cleaning flights.
 However, even efforts, 12% people flying (compared last year, time) 27th May 2020.
 Aviation Tourism industries curse a luxury expense thus, Coronavirus pandemic spread, entire industry jolted a halt. They hardest-hit sectors adapt a normal wherein revenue levels unlikely match pre-COVID levels margins also reduced. However, a bleak future, industry stay people travel, eventually vacation well.
