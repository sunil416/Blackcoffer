 Encrypt data
 Various publicly available tools taken rocket science encrypting (and decrypting) email files. Data encryption isn’t technology geeks; modern tools make possible anyone encrypt emails information. “Encryption used sole province geeks mathematicians, a lot changed recent years. In particular, various publicly available tools taken rocket science encrypting (and decrypting) email files. GPG Mail, example, open-source plug-in Apple Mail program makes easy encrypt, decrypt, sign verify emails using OpenPGP standard. And protecting files, newer versions Apple’s OS operating system come FileVault, a program encrypts hard drive a computer. Those running Microsoft Windows a similar program. This software scramble data, won’t protect government authorities demanding encryption key Regulation Investigatory Powers Act (2000), aficionados recommend TrueCrypt, a program interesting facilities, might useful David Miranda,” explains John Naughton article The Guardian.
 Backup data
 One basic, yet often overlooked, data protection tips backing data. Basically, creates a duplicate copy data a device lost, stolen, compromised, don’t also lose important information.

Gartner found downtime cost companies much $300,000 hour.”
 The cloud provides a viable backup option
 While use sound security practices you’re making use cloud, provide ideal solution backing data. Since data stored a local device, it’s easily accessible even hardware becomes compromised. “Cloud storage, data kept offsite a provider, a guarantee adequate disaster recovery,” according post TechRadar.

 Anti-malware protection a must.
 Scammers sneaky: sometimes malware cleverly disguised email a friend a useful website. Malware a serious issue plaguing computer users, it’s known cropping inconspicuous places, unbeknownst users.

But scammers sneaky: sometimes malware cleverly disguised email a friend a useful website. Even cautious web-surfers likely pick infection point.,” explains Clark Howard. Twitter: @ClarkHoward

 Practice Principle Least Privilege (PoLP).
 Indiana University Information Technology recommends following Principle Least Privilege (PoLP): “Do log a computer administrator rights unless must perform specific tasks. Running computer administrator (or a Power User Windows) leaves computer vulnerable security risks exploits. Simply visiting unfamiliar Internet site high-privilege accounts cause extreme damage computer, reformatting hard drive, deleting files, creating a user account administrative access. When need perform tasks administrator, always follow security procedures.” Twitter: @IndianaUniv
 Use “passphrases” rather “passwords.”
 What’s difference? “…we recommend use passphrases–a series random words a sentence. The characters passphrase has, stronger is.  The advantage much easier remember type, hard cyber attackers hack.” explains SANS. Twitter: @SANSAwareness
