 The democratization data access usage enterprise underway. Establishing data governance organization-wide information management becomes a must.
 Metadata management allows end-to-end traceability, data sourcing data consumption. This traceability required personal data regulations GDPR.
 Traceability
 Traceability means transparency flows goods data – a basic requirement a modern supply chain.
 Consumers, authorities various quality assurance product standards demand transparent information raw materials primary packaging. Brand owners need able fully answer questions quickly, batch level, source raw materials, production methods, staging points. With a good traceability information system, a brand owner guarantee protection consumers itself. It quickly contain problems provide adequate information, builds confidence consumers authorities.
 Solution
 We choose MUML underlying software design method due existing support real-time, due preliminary work approach (cf. Sect. 4). Furthermore, rely consensus specification requirements due tight integration MUML. More precisely, provide following partial solutions traceability problem information flow requirements:
 Specification illegitimate information flow level consensus system models. To address challenge C1, provide systems engineers a specification technique information flow requirements, allowing mark a flow elements a system, environment, illegitimate. The specification needs take place a form enables a later comparison against actual information flow detected verification. Thus, distinguishing illegitimate legitimate flow, possible judge whether information flow requirements violated.
 Deriving verifiable information flow properties specified requirements automatic fashion. As a contribution challenge C3, derived properties relate initial requirements a MUML software design model allow verify model’s compliance. In order produce meaningful verification results, derived properties need preserve semantics initial requirements and, therefore, derivation needs interrelate consensus system model MUML software design model. It beneficial infer relation models automatically traces a model transformation.
 Real-time verification non-interference properties basis software design models. In order overcome challenge i.e., decide whether a given MUML model fulfills derived information flow properties, rigorous verification non-interference needs carried out. To end, enrich theoretical basis real-time non-interference a ready-to-use verification technique. To cope infinite, real-valued state space, explicitly consider applicability existing verification techniques area real-time model checking.
 Reinterpretation verification results trace back initial requirements a contribution challenge C3. Depending complexity interrelations MUML software design Conses system model, verification results obtained far significance, allow engineers draw immediate conclusions initial information flow requirements. Therefore, order give significance results, automatically relate back requirements specified initially. Every specified requirement needs marked met (if non-occurrence information flow proved verification), a violation (if verification detected occurrence illegitimate flow).
 Previous studies shown software traceability, ability link together related artifacts different sources within a project (e.g., source code, use cases, documentation, etc.), improves project outcomes assisting developers stakeholders common tasks impact analysis, concept location, etc. Establishing traceability links a software system important costly task, half struggle. As project undergoes maintenance evolution, artifacts added existing ones changed, resulting outdated traceability information. Therefore, specific steps need taken make sure traceability links maintained tandem rest project. In article, address problem propose a novel approach called TRAIL maintaining traceability information a system.
 Advantages benefits full traceability
 Traceability open supply chain help company achieving:
 Increase customer satisfaction safety
 In event a recall take place, manufacturers able minimize impact recalling items specific serial numbers built faulty component, material process – thus significantly reducing expenses customer impact.
 Meet government compliance mandates
 Ease burden lessen chances fines penalties associated noncompliance.
  Improve data accuracy
 Reduce human error.
 Save millions lost revenue, recall costs, damage control campaigns, litigation, fines.
 Mobile track-and-trace solutions prevent quality issues occur or, event a product recall, allow manufacturers act swiftly well narrow scope recall reduce exposure negative brand impressions damage revenues.
 Reduce warranty claim costs
 Traceability enables manufacturers accurately analyze root cause a product part failure recover warranty costs liable suppliers.
 With automation traceability solutions discrete manufacturers, track warranty part information up-sell cross-sell complementary products services.
 In addition, labor hours reallocated focus revenue-generating activities versus double reporting occurs data collected manually later transferred a computer system. For purpose, a traceability system identifies objects using a representation format serial numbers lot numbers, well transfer medium labels RF tags.
 When people related supply chain, including consumers, recognize status product objects information linked, tracing forward/back done easily. This ensures quality safety product.
 We currently work towards reducing verification problem a refinement check real-time systems. After preparing verification backend, plan address requirements specification level model-based systems engineering, derivation verifiable properties within next year. Finally, intend carry final integration systems engineering software design order establish desired traceability solution. Our evaluation strategy enables us carry a stepwise, incremental validation contributions.
