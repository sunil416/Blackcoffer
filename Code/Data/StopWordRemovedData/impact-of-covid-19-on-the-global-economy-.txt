 INTRODUCTION
 Coronavirus disease  (COVID-19)  infectious disease caused a  newly discovered coronavirus.
 Most people infected COVID-19 virus experience mild moderate respiratory disease recover without requiring special treatment. Older age people underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, cancer likely develop serious illness.
 The prevent slow transmission well informed COVID-19  virus,  disease causes spreads.  Protect others infection washing hands using alcohol-based rub frequently touching face.
 The  COVID-19  virus spreads primarily droplets saliva discharges nose infected person suffering coughs sneezes, important also practice respiratory etiquette  (for example,  coughing a flexed elbow).
 At time, specific vaccines treatments virus. However, ongoing clinical trials calculating potential treatments. Which continue provide regular basis information clinical findings become available
 IMPACT
 The emergence COVID-19 a tragic public-health emergency. The disease, hopes, brought control quickly, International Monetary Fund already warning economic growth  China slow.  As watch situation unfold, broader risks global economy also becoming apparent clear.
 The risk obviously China itself. While precise origins disease remain unclear, hard take a definite view whether outbreaks kind could avoided – example, better control hygiene food markets. But painfully obvious a lack transparency China contributed fear even signs panic around world.
 As financial markets go 2007-2008, precise incidence big risks well understood, people tend assume worse. Rapidly falling asset prices contain much information–except much information had.
 The Chinese authorities surely answers point, inclination suppress data interpretation tremendously unhelpful.
 Second, lack American leadership painfully apparent every day. The United States strongest medical-health system facilities world, capacity research development  (government private)  none.  Yet  President  Donald  Trump’s administration seems concerned primarily playing risks keeping virus United States America – a nearly impossible task.
 The private sector working hard a  vaccine,  commendable. Unfortunately,  a  longer period time,  lack a  consistent market vaccines undermined investment sector. By creating world’s largest market drugs, US effectively supports research across a wide range ailments – large steady demand US.
 Even fervent believer  Trump’s  “America  First”  must willing concede America’s interest rest world become sick. These US allies, friends, customers. Also, like not, diseases stop  America’s borders.  Indeed,   US  Centers  Disease  Control Prevention (CDC) said question if, rather when, COVID-19 spreads domestically.
 The risk emerging markets developing countries. Poorer countries ill-equipped deal kind disease,  seen  African countries’ refusal airlift citizens China.
 The news coronavirus reached  Italy shaken world financial markets,   Italy a  relatively well-organized rich country. A vibrant democracy ensures people quickly understand containment treatment measures working.
 We much concerned countries, nutrition worse, housing standards weak, disease transmission occur much readily. If countries’ health systems come pressure, US, Europe, others step quickly technical assistance essential supplies. But here, too, far a worrying lack leadership.
 It seems unlikely disease prove deadly ancestors experienced. Medical practice public health advanced a great deal. The  CDC  outstanding organization,   World  Health Organization a  strong track record chips down. Private-sector groups dedicated doctors nurses performed extraordinarily well difficult circumstances, dealing Ebola, given a chance. We fortunate live age heroic people.
 Still, coronavirus a warning. Societies neglect access health-care systems reduce investments Research development great peril. Diseases always evolving, must continually increase capacity understand fight newly emerging threats.
 The forward strengthening science, training scientists, building labs. Countries able like US share ideas knowledge widely possible.
 Investing science appealing economic proposition. Given high rates   social  return, basic  research  across a wide range  activities  pays itself
 But economics. More likely not, day a scientist save life life a loved previous work produced a drug, treatment, idea made a critical difference. We invest scientists save neighbors. Also, must remember neighbors deeply interconnected world.
 Global shares take a hit
 Big shifts stock markets,  shares companies bought sold,  affect investments pensions individual savings accounts (ISAs).
 The FTSE, Dow Jones Industrial Average Nikkei seen huge falls since outbreak began 31 December.

 Investors fear spread coronavirus destroy economic growth government action enough stop decline.
 In response, central banks countries, including United Kingdom, slashed interest rates.
 That should, theory, make borrowing cheaper encourage spending boost economy.
 Global markets also recover ground US Senate passed a $2 trillion (£1.7tn) coronavirus aid bill help workers businesses.
 But analysts warned could volatile pandemic contained.

India attracts nearly million foreign tourists a month, travel restrictions could impact next months. The situation India far better compared countries hit a global pandemic, Sarkar said.
 India annually earns nearly  $30  billion foreign tourist arrivals,  industry worried a global spread virus harm already weakened economic growth.
 As situation take time recover economy India globally a recession government come measure.
 If look recent action US FED countries step took a thought pressure deeper looks like situation different happen 2008 crisis 1998 time none factories closed time work stoped importantly economy past 1 year facing slow sectors impact small companies badly.
 But think another a shift a lot pattern like people go short term investment stock market due uncertainty life, Insurance stocks benefited, logistics & distribution network totally change factories try procure material nearest location increase personal saving people automakers real estate sector hit hard.
 If estimate, take around 1 year get back a track happen government central bank continuously come relief measure
