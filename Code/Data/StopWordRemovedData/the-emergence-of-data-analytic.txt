 Data forms i.e. primary data, secondary data, experimental data, sales data, transactional data, operational data, strategic data, log data much more. Data potential transform business drive creation business value. Data used a range simple tasks managing dashboards i.e. operation, strategic analytical visualizing relationships. However, real power data lies use analytical tools (BI tool, R, Python, excel etc.) allow user extract useful knowledge quantify factors impact events. Some examples include Customer sentiment analysis, customer churn analytics, geospatial analysis key operation centers, workforce planning, recruiting, smart planning, risk-sensing.
 Analytical tools discovery last decade, fact, centuries. Statistical regressions classification models around part 20th century. It is, however, explosive growth data times combined advanced computational power renders data analytics a key tool across businesses industries.
 In Financial Industry, examples using data analytics create business value include fraud detection, customer segmentation, churn prevention, insurance premium modeling, risk modeling, credit score modeling, employee client retention.
 In order data analytics reveal potential add value business, a certain number ingredients need place. This particularly true recent times explosion big data (big implying data volume, velocity, variety). Some ingredients listed below:
 Distributed file systems
 The analysis data requires sophisticated infrastructure support work motion. For large amounts data, market standards platforms like Apache Hadoop consists a component responsible storing data Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) a component responsible processing data MapReduce. Surrounding solution entire ecosystem additional software packages Pig, Hive, Spark, etc. Could solutions Google cloud, AWS cloud, Azure making whole system easier used before.
 Database management
 An important aspect analysis data management database. An entire ecosystem database systems exists: relational, object-oriented, NoSQL-type, graph-database, neo4j, etc. Well, known database management systems include SQL, Oracle, Sybase, MongoDB, Graph-database. These based use a primary key locate entries. Other databases require fixed table schemas designed scale horizontally. Apache Cassandra, example, designed aim handle big data single point failure.
 Advanced analytics
 Advanced analytics refers a variety statistical methods used compute likelihoods event occurring. Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Integration, Statistical Analysis solve problems beyond think of. Popular software launch analytic solution R, Python, Java, SPSS, etc. The zoo analytics methods extremely rich. However, data come industrial package, human judgment crucial order understand performance possible pitfalls alternatives a solution.
