 Machine learning techniques used years, recently explosion applications. In fact, a recent Q3 earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said “Machine learning a core, transformative we’re re-thinking we’re everything.” And they’re far business making claim.
 In past, successful use machine learning algorithms required bespoke algorithms huge R&D budgets, changing. IBM Watson, Microsoft Azure, Amazon, Alibaba launched turnkey cloud-based machine-learning SaaS solutions 2015. At time startups like Idibon, MetaMind, Dato, MonkeyLearn built machine learning products companies take advantage of.
 Gartner already puts machine learning top hype curve, no: machine learning won’t replace employees computers suddenly double revenue. But doesn’t mean can’t give every business a competitive advantage. There plenty business processes significantly benefit machine learning. So machine learning change businesses operate?

 Bigger upfront costs
 First thing’s first: Machine learning needs training data training data costs money. Especially training data labeled humans. Let explain. To make machine learning work business, algorithm needs lots lots examples it’s supposed doing. If want algorithm tell a sales lead good, need show lots lots examples good sales leads bad sales leads. If want algorithm tag support tickets need show examples support tickets. If localize algorithm a language probably need collect lots examples language. In instances, a company training sets in-house. For example, a bunch disqualified qualified leads. But say haven’t labeled support tickets they’ve come year. You’d need people either in-house en masse a data enrichment platform -label tickets. The machine look judgments start finding connections patterns learn from.
 Much lower ongoing costs
 Machine learning much cheaper efficient people works well. The downside often works well 80 percent cases badly 20 percent cases, lowering 20 percent error rate hard, impossible. But even 80 percent accurate algorithm save a lot money good machine learning algorithms know accurate likely errors. Smart companies take cases algorithm high confidence uses directly sending low confidence cases humans. Banks years. When put a check ATM, algorithm tries decipher numbers check. If really sloppy handwriting ink smudged algorithm passes task a human. This design pattern saves banks lots money preserving a high level accuracy.
 Your costs drop time
 A huge benefit machine learning turn part variable cost a fixed cost. If use humans handle cases algorithm struggling, creating perfect training data feed algorithm. This a well-studied technique called active learning turns training data labels collected cases algorithm low confidence help algorithm learn much, much efficiently.
 As algorithm becomes increasingly accurate, unit economics business process become better machine learning becomes able handle cases, expensive humans called toughest, rarest situations. That means use human machine intelligence tandem: leveraging speed reliability computers easy judgments fluency expertise humans difficult ones. And sounds like smart business, it’s is.
