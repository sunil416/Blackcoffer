 What’s perfection really? Does every person expect perfection oneself someone else? Or certain amounts? Many times certain question comes mind think deem perfect. But verify it?
 Let us understand work individuals know put a task carpentry a budget. All given Rs. 5000 (Assumed) complete task. They can’t go beyond budget.
 Manish, Vinay, Sameer need make a stool each. Manish understanding carpentry; learns YouTube. Vinay took carpentry lessons engineering, a practical idea make a stool. But Sameer a Carpenter, a total understanding material, process, final product.
 Let us start Manish. Understand task get jobs done. Manish options here. He either order parts assemble order material required wood, glue, nails, etc work assembly final product. The difference lack expertise field.
 Vinay options practical experience carpentry classes workshop Engineering. Sameer advantage since skill experience perfected a course time.
 All given days task. Since Manish finds easy assemble stool using parts procured another carpenter; talks a carpenter knows orders 3 leg parts, 6 horizontal support bars, circular base sit top. Vinay thinks able shape parts experience a student orders several cylindrical wooden leg parts, cuboidal bars, a thick sheet. Sameer required material shop begins work stool day.
 Manish Vinay wait a day parts come. They begin work day. Manish uses tricks learned YouTube videos; uses a hammer place nails purchased a nearby shop pre-made hole, applies glue certain areas directed video, places weight assembled stool. He waits glue cure.
 Vinay uses borrowed drill bits, drill machines, cutters, sandpapers purchased a shop, etc, starts working wooden parts parts arrive morning. He able recall carpentry instructions attempts shape parts based drawing product made last night. Sameer meanwhile completed assembly put assembly rest glue cure.
 On day, stool ready. They evaluate work notice certain facts.
 Manish notices complete task but, stool wobbly glued well. It could fall moment sits it. Also, forgets polish wooden parts give a professional finish since forgot watch bit video YouTube.
 Vinay completes task stool sturdy cured well overnight. But minor issues it. One legs cut short a mm stool, a tad unstable.
 Sameer hand completes task a good product. The stool well-balanced, polished, expected him. Sameer satisfied work finds stool Perfect. Manish thinks considering experience task done. He satisfied work. But Vinay unhappy, could done better made product better. He doesn’t find efforts well put thinks wasn’t productive enough hence stool nowhere perfect.
 Understand a set skills experience, Sameer right skills experience produce a perfect product. Manish Sameer satisfied happy work. Manish made a wobbly stool could break moment someone sat happy gave task a go. He thinks put efforts a good job. It Vinay could overcome fact work perfect.
 In Vinay’s case, observed could deliver learned carpentry classes. The reason simple, put effort didn’t experience. Experience mattered. Since Vinay thinks otherwise, believes perfect skills complete task could deliver results. He satisfied results wishes spend another day working stool get idea perfect result.
 In case, idea perfection misplaced. You see, end product made Vinay Manish would match Sameer’s task could completed understood shortcomings lied. For both, skill. Sameer perfect skill get expected result resulted better productivity, others didn’t.
 And story, every individual put effort regardless result. But satisfied dissatisfied. Their satisfaction made creations perfect eyes dissatisfaction made believe wasn’t productive enough.  
 “Perfection subjective productivity utility extracted given a certain amount effort”.
 You try productive achieve something ultimately, it’s satisfaction get defines boundary perfection. If aren’t satisfied, won’t find anything perfect. You would waste time effort something doesn’t suit place, explained story before.
 “It isn’t productivity greatest enemy satisfaction”.
 Satisfaction determine perceive perfection defines threshold perfection lies. The real enemy dissatisfaction. You get demotivated restless. You lose sight discontinue unable pass expectation. So, it’s obstacle comes productivity, time time.
 Productivity far enemy. The greatest enemy expectations lead dissatisfaction. It play a major role crafting idea Perfection every day.
