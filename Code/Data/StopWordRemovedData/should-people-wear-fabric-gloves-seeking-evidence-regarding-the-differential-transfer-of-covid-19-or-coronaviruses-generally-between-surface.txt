 Is evidence whether fabric bare hands would spread covid-19 surface another? (e.g. opening a door using a fabric glove). Assuming fabric doesn’t touch face, like bare hands easily do, even efforts remember people struggle remember. I’ve thinking prompts prevent face touching, wearing fabric gloves about, don’t want promote unless fabric at-least-no-worse hands transferring virus surfaces.
 I’m talking use community instance people travel go food shops, a healthcare context. The gloves changed different settings (e.g. apartment block, bus, shop – switch a pair gloves each). The gloves ironed hot end day.
 As far tell attempts searching, evidence-based, I’m keen know someone better interpreting evidence field sensible.
 Use fabric gloves avoid spreading Coronavirus outside every person going daily work touching every using gloves entering house remove glove outside home clean hand sanitizer kill virus.  Use glove wash sanitizer bowling water 60 70c put outside home drying night time morning gloves used. Any time go outside come back come better avoid spreading Coronavirus.
 Well, risk conducting covid19 using gloves gloves remember us touch eyes, mouth, nose don’t get infection properly contact infected patient, time wearing gloves become a must.
