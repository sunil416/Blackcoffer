 Artificial intelligence (AI) important branch computer science era big data. AI born 50 years ago came a long way, making encouraging progress, especially machine learning, data mining, computer vision, expert systems, natural language processing, robotics, related applications. Machine learning popular branch AI. Other classes AI include probabilistic models, deep learning, artificial neural network systems, game theory. These classes developed applied a wide range sectors. Recently, leading research area transportation engineering, especially traffic congestion prediction. Traffic congestion prediction provides authorities required time plan allocation resources make journey smooth travelers.

 AI TACKLE ROAD TRAFFIC CONGESTION:                        
 AI traffic management poised revamp urban transportation, relieving bottlenecks choke-points routinely snarl urban traffic. This help us reduce congestion travel time also reduce emissions. Traffic congestion mostly occurs due negligence certain factors like distance maintained moving vehicles, traffic lights, road signs. congestion leads higher fuel consumption, increased air pollution, unnecessarily wastage time & energy, chronic stress & physiological problems, whereas higher traffic violations major cause road fatalities. Intelligent traffic management systems refer usage AI, machine learning, computer vision, sensors, data analysis tools collect analyze traffic data, generate solutions, apply traffic infrastructure. AI use live camera feeds, sensors, even Google Maps develop traffic management solutions feature predictive algorithms speed traffic flow. Siemens Mobility recently built AI-based monitoring system processes video feeds traffic cameras. It automatically detects traffic anomalies alerts traffic management authorities. The system effective estimating road traffic density modulate traffic signals accordingly smoother movement. The integration artificial intelligence machine learning support smart transportation applications including emergency vehicle preemption, transit signal priority, pedestrian safety.
 AI AVIATION TRAFFIC CONTROL
 Air traffic management stands benefit significantly artificial intelligence (AI) reliance repetitive activity – lends analysis machine learning. In addition, much complexity embedded driving factors deliver safe air traffic control: example flight planning, flow management, safety assessments, conflict prediction.
 FUTURE AI TRAFIC MANAGEMENT
 Every year a large number vehicles appear streets worldwide, contributing traffic congestion. AI deep learning technologies play a vital role managing traffic collating analyzing data a variety sources. Insights accelerate traffic movements. The future AI traffic management would give birth smart AI applications automate accelerate processes.
 ADVANTAGES AI TRAFFIC CONGESTION :
 The use Artificial Intelligence (AI) Intelligent Traffic Management (ITMS) help tackle & solve issues related traffic law enforcement. It facilitate a smooth, convenient & safer experience commuters improving road traffic discipline. Such a system can’t help law enforcement agencies penalizing offenders act a deterrent well. Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) Artificial Intelligence (AI) based application coupled cameras installed traffic junctions, provide a tool detect identify vehicles disobeying traffic rules generate real-time alerts Central Command Center. It automatically challan offenders per law land send electronically violators. Each e-challan associated supporting evidence data terms snapshots & videos. This system also track flow pace traffic movement provide real-time traffic management. In addition improving traffic conditions, ITMS also contributes towards smart city goals like environmental sustainability. To improve traffic behavior & avoid congestions a city, a Traffic management & enforcement system deployed solve traffic-related issues, including limited – Automated Number Plate Reading, Red Light Violation Detection, Speed Violation Detection, Triple Riding & No Helmet Detection, Free Left Turn Obstruction, Wrong-Way Driving, No Seat Belt & Mobile phone usage driving, Hot listed vehicle detection, Traffic Flow & Congestion detection, etc.
 Such ITMS system integrated existing CCTV & Traffic Control system provide a holistic solution towards preventing current traffic menace. Not this, various AI-based traffic analytic deployed existing Traffic enforcement surveillance system also, minor tweaking & adjustments, resulting a highly optimized solution a lower cost public exchequer.
 An AI-powered system, trained deep learning reduce traffic. Commuters plan journeys per system updates. Since takes every small detail roads account, AI-powered system keep drivers road authorities step ahead. Here a significant advantages AI-powered system traffic analysis:-
 1) Lane-by-lane analysis
 The system analyze traffic different lanes enough precision ease traffic movements. Using data, drivers reduce commuting time significantly. Effectively, drivers road authorities make better decisions avoid traffic congestion.
 2) Real-time updates keep driver step ahead
 Every critical information road conditions, road accidents congestion, puts driver road authorities step ahead.
 3) Wide coverage
 An AI-powered system potential analyze traffic across multiple regions. It map efficient routes alter traffic signals improve traffic conditions.
 4) Fuel minimization
 AI machine learning algorithms identify least-efficient vehicles, track path speed change traffic signals ahead vehicles.  This eliminates much inefficient starting stopping intersections minimizes fuel consumption.
 APPLICATIONS AI TRAFFIC CONTROL
 As far using Artificial Intelligence open space, roads, concerned, considered a possibility install AI-enabled traffic management system part infrastructure launching self-driving vehicles. An AI-enabled traffic management system provide greater leeway self-driving vehicles directed controlled external environment.  Recently, Delhi Traffic Police obtained permission Ministry Home Affairs set intelligent traffic management system (ITMS) work radar-based monitoring help Artificial Intelligence. One key tools system automated traffic signals. It help Delhi Traffic Police analyze traffic pattern, volume, number vehicles collect a cloud used manage traffic. It also contain features like high-resolution CCTV cameras capture commuters motorists breaking laws automated number plate recognition cameras (ANPR) directly send challan (fine slip) homes lawbreakers. With Artificial Intelligence working traffic signals based traffic volume, congested roads opened a longer duration traffic clear leading a reduction congestion.
 CONCLUSION
 Traffic congestion prediction getting attention last decades. With development infrastructure, every country facing a traffic congestion problem. The development artificial intelligence availability big data led researchers apply different models field. Deep learning algorithms became popular time assess a large data set. However, a wide range machine learning algorithms yet applied. Therefore, a vast opportunity research field traffic congestion prediction prevails. The power AI propels a lot data analysis systems, also powers navigation systems ride-hailing well last-mile delivery operators. Deliveries order fulfillment delayed past, enhanced significantly cities around Asia continue taking intelligent traffic systems.
