 Have heard movie Big Hero 6? It’s animated movie guy named Tadashi built AI machine Baymax, inflatable healthcare robot, could army camps place medical sector mark a plot twist later turned a war machine younger brother. The whole idea telling concept shown a reality would come effect coming years. AI something drastically put impact ways working like take a years back think payment internet buying things watching pics online shopping is. AI making everything effective, available importantly boundaries.
 The healthcare sector knowledge associated complex. Health check-ups, today, limited checking patient’s temperature asking questions. With amplified number complex diseases, even technology get advance. Modern tests, complex medication processes, restful treatment require high-end technologies better healthcare industry.  This AI making medical industry bring a drastic effect healthcare sector ways –
 DEVELOPMENT RADIOLOGY TOOLS
 Radiological images obtained MRI machines, CT scanners, x-rays offer non-invasive visibility inner workings human body.  But diagnostic processes rely physical tissue samples obtained biopsies, carry risks including potential infection.
 Artificial intelligence enable next generation radiology tools accurate detailed enough replace need tissue samples cases, experts predict.
 MAKING PATHOLOGY IMAGES PRECISE
 Pathologists provide significant sources diagnostic data providers across spectrum care delivery, says Jeffrey Golden, MD, Chair Department Pathology BWH.
 “Seventy percent decisions healthcare based a pathology result,” said.
 Somewhere 70 75 percent data electronic health record a pathology result. So, accurate get, sooner get right diagnosis, better we’re going be. That’s digital pathology AI opportunity deliver. Analytics drill pixel level extremely large digital images allow providers identify nuances escape human eye.
 ADVANCE WEARABLES PERSONAL DEVICES MONITORING HEALTH
 Almost consumers access devices sensors collect valuable data health.  From smartphones step trackers wearables track a heartbeat around clock, a growing proportion health-related data generated go. Collecting analyzing data – supplementing patient-provided information apps home monitoring devices – offer a unique perspective individual population health. Artificial intelligence play a significant role extracting actionable insights large varied treasure trove data.
 SMARTPHONES POWERFUL DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS
 Continuing theme harnessing power portable devices, experts believe images taken smartphones consumer-grade sources important supplement clinical quality imaging – especially underserved populations developing nations. The quality cell phone cameras increasing every year produce images viable analysis artificial intelligence algorithms. Researchers United Kingdom even developed a tool identifies developmental diseases analyzing images a child’s face.  The algorithm detect discrete features, a child’s jawline, eye nose placement, attributes might indicate a craniofacial abnormality.  Currently, tool match ordinary images 90 disorders provide clinical decision support.
 Not AI upgrading health care industry this, completely changing for. AI begin chapter health care industry, change traditional method treatment analysis. The doctor able treat patient a much effective way, AI reduce pressure them. The doctor less likely say, “they can’t help it’s late” patient. Who knows day come like home, we’re using Alexa, future bring virtual assistants embedded intelligence bedside humans use medical problem.
 Many would say end day AI manmade creation, flaw it, can’t fully trust them, glitch it, doctor AI never able do. In modern world existence a pandemic situation, AI never able take place a doctor assistance AI, a doctor able handle situation efficiently gradation modern technology, well prepared a situation like covid-19, hope never come future. At last, AI usher a era mankind exciting breakthroughs human world, since today AI machine play a important role every human’s life, nowadays becoming important water living.
