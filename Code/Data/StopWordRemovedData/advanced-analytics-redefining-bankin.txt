 The banking industry going a transformational journey comprehensive usage Advanced Analytics algorithms day day business core banking. Customer acquisition various channels, existing customer engagement, predicting defaulters credit card loan applications, etc areas analytics a tremendous job. explain scenarios past experience working advanced analytics team a leading multinational bank used interesting concepts analytics machine learning solve complex business problems.
 Customer God (or so?)
 It impossible track God, track potential customers help advanced analytics algorithms. A lot information buying patterns, demographics, transactions, service requests, etc available banks. This used efficiently predict propensity a customer buying a specific product. While working analytics department, collaborated sales teams needed a rank-ordered list potential future customers direct mailer/cold calling campaigns. The campaigns usually contain attractive offer specific product, like lower interest rate a credit card, higher interest savings account, etc. hedged confidence significant number customers ranked list would buying product, opposed ones contacted randomly. Not potential customers a product, also customers mindset close account (Customer Attrition) predicted.
 Data science algorithms Logistic Regression work well predicting probability customer propensity buy customer attrition probability. For example, consider real-life business problem:
 A leading MNC bank wants formulate a strategy curb customer attrition, constantly rise, Savings Account product. They reach Advanced Analytics department help retaining customers predicting a propensity towards closing account connect offer attractive offers continue invaluable relationship.
 The Advanced Analytics team starts narrowing problem defining Attrition, eg- customers taking parked money, closing Savings Account, reinvesting money another product offered bank. The business wants predict attrition 3 months advance get sufficient time design a retention strategy.
 The team moves collect required data, usually takes time project questions like data collect, much time period, additional data needed, etc. critical requirements. Once stage set, Data Scientists perform final act – Machine Learning. The algorithms read data find patterns leading attrition behavior based previous account closures. It leverage learning newly available customer information current scenario predicts probability attrition.
 came across astounding project predicting customer propensity buy retail banking products 10 years today! Guess driving feature algorithms? That’s right, current educational background achievements tracked business social media websites lead understanding person would want park money future.
 One interesting use Natural Language Processing algorithms like Naïve Bayes classifier retail banking analyzing transactions. Each transaction associated a code a short description. Data scientists use language parsing extract keywords tokens humongous text generated read description discover transaction. It identified whether paid a product a retail store, transferred money another bank account hold paid bill a credit card another bank. The transactions linked value current relationship bank business decide upon various customer outreach strategies based critical information.
 They buy see
 According laws economics, choices spoil us. The options front customers, confused become chances buying product. A niche field makes use hardcore machine learning algorithms Targeted Digital Marketing, retail banking constantly using identify catch potential customers visiting website displaying customized web content caters needs visitors offer products looking for. How business know customer wants? Digital Footprints!
 Millions website visitors generate thousands GBs data contain information channel come from, frequent landing page bank’s website, pages scan through, much time spend reading content, unique visits make per day week etc. This data called Digital Footprint a website visitor, also called Clickstream Data. Banking financial institutions churning data generate accurate information exactly visitor looking for, efficiently display customized content visitors products would interested displayed home page. This prompts visitor click display link understand product, saying goes, buy see. You display much content altogether confuse visitor might log without making deal, without leaving information contacted later. The information digital footprints customized extent % rate visitor would convert on! Customized content displayed based current visitors show characteristics visitors past got converted. Since conversion rate minimal a millions visitors bank’s website actually buy a product service online, need use powerful machine learning algorithms catch pattern limited amount data learn on. Also, a huge amount data needs read algorithm digital footprints get generated second. Machine Learning algorithms Random Forest (which use Bagging methodology) Gradient Boosting (which use Boosting methodology) come rescue. These algorithms efficient handling huge amount data identify patterns good accuracy. Data Scientists also use a technique called Stacking outputs different algorithms combined fed another model calculate probability a combination various machine learning algorithms.
 So, next time visit a bank’s website pop-up displays offering attractive interest rate home loan, assured a heavily loaded machine learning algorithm running background monitored activity website knows looking for.
 Clustering – stop shop analytics solutions
 Majority decision making Banks Financial Institutions done dividing things groups similar characteristics behave a particular way, decisions applied batches saves time, energy course money. Clustering algorithms rescue! cannot count number times proposed clusters a solution a business problem would share instances distinctly remember so.
 The a bank wanted identify loyal customers from, well, loyal. Our approach define loyalty based metrics: recency transactions, frequency transactions monetary value transactions (better known RFM model analytics world). These metrics combined, a certain weight assigned based important business, enable us rank customers interacting compared others (who eventually dormant fall loyal category). An important consideration study transactions depth otherwise errors might creep in. For instance, interesting, developed categories based RFM score, saw every single savings account holder scored high recency value. This intriguing us spent days identifying happening, later realize every savings account interest receivable account holder, credits account end month. The trade-offs technical suppose.
 The instance business wanted identify bank branches lower average performance, metrics like customers acquired, average balances maintained accounts, quality home loan applications sent head branch approval, promoter score customers, employee attrition, etc. Using k-means clustering, identified differentiated high performing branches metrics lower ones. This helped bank taking decisions like reviewing financial targets lower performing branches provide focus employee training, also incentivize high performing branches inspire others.
 The core idea behind advanced analytics data science algorithms help business make better decisions faster. They say data oil, analytics process converting oil fuel.
