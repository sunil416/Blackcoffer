 “Data oil” become important trendline 21st century. The reason advancements fields related data analysis. The field AI Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining deal data developing a staggering pace, fields become popular buzzwords days.
 Buzzwords originated technical terms often underlying essence ignored fashionable use mainly used impress. This main reason misconception amongst people. AI, ML, Stats, Data Mining, fields related analysis data often mistook thing, thus words often used interchangeably convey thing. But true all!
 The similarity disciplines disciplines related analysis data converting data “information”.
 In academics, learning AI Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining, academic approach wander technical definitions concepts underlying essence aim discipline remain unexplored, case articles try explain difference. Thus, becoming primary cause confusion learners. Hence, article explains difference explaining philosophy aims disciplines rather wandering technical definitions.
 Then difference AI Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining?
 The essential difference disciplines lies “aims” approach taken achieve aims.
 The aims fields explained detail following sections:
 Artificial Intelligence:
 The aim Artificial intelligence understand intelligent entities. Then satisfy aim, must understand intelligence makes agent intelligent agent? The answer questions found studying intelligent agents example intelligent agent found standing front a mirror! Yes! Humans examples intelligent entities. Thus, 1900s, researchers began exploring thought process, reasoning process humans human beings considered ideal intelligent agent. Mimicking human behavior became aim AI initial years research. After setting goal, studies experiments began famous experiment conducted initial years achieve aim Turing Test! Turing defined intelligent behavior ability achieve human-level performance cognitive tasks, sufficient fool interrogator. But test received criticism mimicking human behavior exactly intelligence. Because intelligence related working human brain without human brain, intelligence meaning!
             Thus, mimicking human thought processes reasoning became transformed aim. The field Psychology philosophy also resonate aim understand human thought process. The difference AI tries understand thought process mimic it, build it. The collaboration fields resulted models Neural Networks try mimic function neurons present human brain. So, basically, initial aim human-centered humans considered ideal intelligent agent.
 Concurrently, field computer science developing a greater pace. With advances computer science, experiments theories could easily tested validated. As programs applied solve real-life problems, found computers performed better humans tasks really complex humans. One examples could chess-playing program. An AI program defeated world’s chess player Garry Kasparov. This incident indicated human intelligence ultimate intelligence a human would able defeat AI program. This leads a question, human intelligence ideal intelligence?
 As computers became advanced, proved better humans certain complex tasks. That definition intelligence related ability solve cognitive tasks problems. So, rather considering nature agents, researchers began study nature intelligence itself. Then question comes test validate intelligence? The test intelligence solve cognitive problems. An agent said intelligent solve a complex problem. The problem-solving approach easily tested validated computers. Thus, researchers began studying ideal intelligence, selected agent validate experiments computer. So, a computer problem-solving approach adopted. So, human-centered approach computer, problem-solving approach main aims AI. Both fields contributed field giving valuable insights.
 Both aims important collaboratively form main aim AI!
 Machine Learning:
 In problem-solving approach, a big challenge AI overcome order achieve aim. Consider example solving a math problem. There cases intelligence tested problem-solving approach. Let us say math problems given solve. The problem familiar problem not.
 Consider problem. The problem familiar you, means know solve kind problems already solved similar problems past. So, comes a question, mind able solve problem? The answer is, solved similar problems past, thus learned past data, solve problems, thus even haven’t seen problem past, able solve similar problems. This form intelligence.
 Consider another case given a problem solved kind problems past. Then solve problem, try consciously gather manipulate given information reach a certain conclusion. This kind approach necessarily rely past data completely reasoning process. This kind intelligence.
 For AI build intelligent agents, kinds intelligence must developed agent. But, reality AI reached point able build agents learn past data find useful information. AI today reached a point build agents think own. That type intelligence.
 So, AI able implement type intelligence Machine Learning! So, domain AI focuses solely implementing kind intelligence fact Machine Learning. That reason ML called subset AI! So, main difference AI ML.
 Technically speaking, “It field study gives computers ability learn past data find meaningful conclusions, patterns without explicitly programmed”. This statement needs elaboration. The essence ML related process “Generalization” learning past data. Generalization abstraction common properties specific instances formulated general concepts claims. Consider humans recognize daily life objects. If animal, easily recognize a “dog” a “cat”. It a trivial task us ever wondered mind able it? The answer Generalization!
 If given a picture a dog, easily recognize a picture a dog, because, minds abstracted description a dog formulated a “concept” a dog concepts became better better learned past experiences a dog. So, think dependent fact things represented generalized concepts minds.
 With generalization only, come real “information”. So, try give computers ability generalize “raw data” convert “information” patterns trends data own.
 Statistics:
 This discipline concerns collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, presentation data. Statistics tries deal data aim explain it. So, study explaining data itself! Statistics main domains Descriptive statistics Inferential statistics.
 Descriptive statistics deals explanation description data thus name “Descriptive” statistics. It tries explain much information possible, easily whole large data would a complex task otherwise.
  Inferential statistics try make accurate inferences available small data. We use inference tasks daily lives. Consider a simple case cooking a soup. After completing recipe, taste a small sample, is, a spoonful soup check soup tastes good bad. Depending upon result sample, make inference whole soup soup a whole, good bad. Similarly, statistics, cases apply inference meaningful information. For example, consider a case cannot gather whole data time-consuming costly. In cases, applying inference based available sample introduces uncertainty. That inferential statistics come help.
 So, use data context uncertainty decision-making face uncertainty statistics deals with. So, however, whatever data, statistics tries explain data. This aim resonate AI ML, statistics help fields correctly interpret data!
 Data Mining:  
 “Data”, useful raw form. Consider examples sensors used industrial applications. These sensors might used a manufacturing plant sense different properties like temperature, pressure, etc. The raw data generated sensors useful unless converted a suitable form, processed, analyzed gather valuable insights, used solve a problem!
 Due unique aim capturing essence large datasets, gather insights, Data Mining also referred “Knowledge Discovery”. That why, Carly Fiorina, former CEO Hewlett-Packard said, “The goal turn data information information Insight”. This statement completely explains aim Data Mining!
             So, difference AI Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining lies aims. But approaches taken fields, help fulfilling aims fields. This beauty fields!
