 The ongoing digitalization business world putting companies risk cyber-attacks ever before. Big data analysis potential offer protection against attacks. 
 Cyber Security Threats Rising
 Since notion a corporate security perimeter disappeared recent years thanks growing adoption cloud mobile services, information security experienced a profound paradigm shift traditional perimeter protection tools towards monitoring detecting malicious activities within corporate networks.
 Increasingly sophisticated attack methods used cybercriminals growing role malicious insiders several recent large scale security breaches clearly indicate traditional approaches information security longer keep up.
 Companies Have Rethink Cyber Security Concepts
 Analytics key element leveraging cyber resilience. With increasingly advanced persistent attacks simple fact every organization must protect against varieties attacks attacker needs successful attempt, organizations must rethink cybersecurity concepts. They move beyond pure prevention towards PDR paradigm: Prevent – Detect – Respond.
 How Big Data Analytics Fits In?
 At core approach stands improved detection – big data analytics comes play. Detection must able identify changing use patterns; execute complex analysis rapidly, close real-time; perform complex correlations across a variety data sources ranging server application logs network events user activities.
 This requires advanced analytics beyond simple rule-based approaches ability run analysis large amounts current historical data – big data security analytics. Combining current state analytics security helps organizations improve cyber resilience.
 Big Data Security Analytics: A New Generation Security Tools
 As security industry’s response challenges, a generation security analytics solutions emerged recent years, able collect, store analyze huge amounts security data across whole enterprise real-time.
 Enhanced additional context data external threat intelligence, data analyzed using various correlation algorithms detect anomalies thus identify possible malicious activities.
 Unlike traditional SIEM solutions, tools operate near real-time generate a small number security alerts ranked severity according a risk model. These alerts enriched additional forensic details able greatly simplify a security analyst’s job enable quick detection mitigation cyber-attacks.
 What Made Big Data Security Analytics Possible?
 The biggest technological breakthrough made solutions possible big data analytics.
 The industry finally reached point business intelligence algorithms large-scale data processing, previously affordable large corporations, become commoditized. Utilizing readily available frameworks Apache Hadoop inexpensive hardware, vendors able build big data solutions collecting, storing, analyzing huge amounts unstructured data real-time.
 Combining Data Predict Suspicious Activity
 This makes possible combine real-time historical analysis identify incidents could related others occurred past.
 Coupled external security intelligence sources provide current information latest vulnerabilities, greatly facilitate identification ongoing advanced cyber-attacks network.
 Having a large amount historical data hand also significantly simplifies initial calibration normal patterns activity a given network, used identify anomalies. Existing solutions already capable automated calibration input required administrators.
 Identifying Relevant Incidents
 Based proven big data analytics algorithms, solutions identify outliers anomalies insecurity data, almost always indicate kind malicious least suspicious activity.
 By filtering statistical noise, big data security analytics reduce massive flows raw security events a manageable number concise clearly categorized alerts allow even inexperienced person make a decision them. Still, keeping historical information available later analysis, provides a forensic expert much detail incident relationship historical anomalies.
 Automating Workflows
 Finally, modern big data security analytics solutions provide multiple automated workflows responding detected threats, disrupting clearly identified malware attacks submitting a suspicious event a managed security service analysis. Automated controls cybersecurity fraud detection identified key business drivers future adoption.
