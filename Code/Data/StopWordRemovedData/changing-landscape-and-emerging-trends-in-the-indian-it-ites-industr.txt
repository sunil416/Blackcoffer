The lockdown simply exacerbated economic predicament; pushing multiple businesses industries a moribund state. Other countries also faced a similar predicament, particularly US Europe, hotspots virus transmission.
 However, upon taking a closer look global economy, seems upward mobilization sectors domain. These sectors seem exorbitantly increased scale operations overall reaped hefty profits. So differentiates areas rest learn them?
 A path victory
 If look evolving IT/ITeS industry around world, domains flourished strenuous time key characteristic common; flexibility. These sectors adopted a flexible approach dealing lockdown. Be flexible working procedures adopting newer, advanced ways working line requirements time, haven’t shied away changing rules game. Let’s look areas within tech domain successful conquering lockdown.
 Social Media
 Lockdowns around globe confined people inside homes, nothing much significance. As a result, social networking sites reported a gigantic rise user engagement lockdown period. Reportedly, close a 50% rise daily text transmissions across messaging platforms Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp hardest-hit economies. Twitter reported a 23% increase user base compared last year. The data makes evident social media platforms reap benefits a lockdown situation.
 Video consumption sites YouTube, Instagram, TikTok line reap massive profits. It’s wonder viewership platforms increased manifolds due lockdowns. These platforms serve a distraction tragedies real world stressing times offer easy escape. Be rumors regarding cure COVID 19, gossips, rap battles; platforms provide viewers much-needed dose distractions. As say, “ignorance bliss”.
 Data-Mining Enterprises
 The lockdown proven a miracle data-mining companies. With exorbitant increase number hours spent online globally, firms access significantly larger sets data otherwise could ever have. Widespread implementation data-mining seen recently countries opting Government-regulated surveillance applications monitor movement times. Moreover, applications access personal information well medical records. Countries South Korea Singapore helm relying means control outbreak.
 Although noble, initiatives raise a red flag regards user privacy. The public provided information applications operate goes behind scenes. This creates atmosphere obscurity frankly harmful premise a democracy.
 Cloud Computing
 Cloud computing rise last couple years. However, pandemic made de facto king terms computational services. With increasing reliance remote working, ability store data secure location turned critical.
 The cloud computing services Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud reaped hefty profits process. The emerging landscape tech world seems suggest upward trend reliability services far large scale data storage computing concerned.
 E-Commerce
 Social distancing measures made practically impossible people physically go shopping groceries necessities. Moreover, a majority retail outlets cities reported negligible engagement, fear transmission virus. E-commerce sites real winners predicament global consumerism.
 With high standards hygiene at-home delivery, sites provided easy alternative retail stores. Other similar businesses include food delivery apps grocery sites also flourishing today amidst pandemic. Recent weeks made evident E-commerce websites well abolish traditional shopping methods.
 OTT Platforms
 Online streaming platforms consist a relatively newer approach entertainment; existence past couple years. They already, however, established a name lockdowns. Sites Netflix Amazon Prime dominating a chunk market share competing heavily movie theatres releases, a now. Now lockdown practically deleting theatres cable TV collective psyche entertainment industry, well becoming platform choice far entertainment masses concerned.
 This already become evident, Zee5 India reporting a whopping 80% increase subscriptions a 50% increase time spent site, within couple weeks lockdown itself. Another platform MUBI reported a 28% rise viewership India a week lockdown commenced. These facts a clear indication exponential growth store platforms, unlikely change anytime soon.
 Video-Conferencing Platforms
 The idea working home set norm professional culture, requires easy effective communicate internet. Not audio text, video conferencing need today. Hence it’s understandable multiple video conferencing services set reap massive profits norm.
 Arguably popular these, Zoom reported a 130% increase price share since beginning 2020. Another platform known Microsoft Teams collaboration suite, operated Microsoft, reported a whopping 12 million increase user base week lockdown US. This data likely upwards trajectory considering increasing pace industries going online.
 The Indian Picture
 The Indian landscape also undergone massive cultural changes. According Rajesh Gopinathan, chief executive officer managing director Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., “work home” model operations stay. He also claimed firms requires a 25% workforce physically present project locations.
 Tata Consultancy Services major players Indian landscape shifted almost 90% workforce a remote borderless workspace model, smaller firms followed suit. What tells us we’re headed a direction we’re unlikely return from. Remote working appears modern protocol operations unlikely change anytime soon.
 However, a major challenge often overlooked circumstances adaptable culture. The culture workspaces drastically altered members workforce dive headfirst business. This critical ensure industry combat pandemic recover gloriously.
 A duality unlike other
 The lockdown presented us a stark contrast unlike we’ve witnessed. Where hand, industries mentioned seem exhibiting exponential growth people thriving every possible resource disposal, unorganized sector MSMEs (Micro, Small Medium Enterprises) seem crux death.
 The sector consists people guidelines work home irrelevant never really option; people fixed wages social security fall back time crisis. As a result lockdown, several MSMEs effectively become inoperable resorted massive layoffs survive. This resulted thousands workers losing jobs nowhere go refuge. A chunk people includes migrant workers lost jobs left avenue feed themselves. Not receiving significant support government, people initiating treks back villages. What witnessed a massive influx migrant workers flooding highways, walking weeks find shelter food. Truck drivers responsible delivering goods also resigned stating means eat closure every food joint highways. Both realities present a stark contrast expose a deep crack societal framework. One reckon won’t heal anytime soon.
 A train Unlikely Halt
 The COVID 19 pandemic restructured social fabric a unlikely change anytime soon. The areas we’ve discussed likely become flagbearers digital revolution decade. An upward mobilization regards massive scale movement industries online seems pertinent today led domains industry. An unfortunate consequence a majority MSMEs cease exist, replaced alternatives we’ve discussed. It seems a never-ending circle ones making a profit situation continue so, others washed collective memory.
