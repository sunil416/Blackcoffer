 “Sometimes illness sits body waiting right time bloom!”, remarked. Bob a consultant globe-trotting 15 days a week finally taken a toll health sat recuperating plush hospital room miles away home New York. Gazing window, suddenly remembered Jacob – physician back home – calling work a days ago warning take sufficient rest control stress levels heartbeat started showing irregularities. Jacob remotely monitoring Bob’s cardiac information since cardiac arrest 2 years ago able guide Bob medication doses diet based real-time data. “Should realized Jacob crying wolf predicted something might go wrong”. Bob a conference felt a shooting pain hand knew another cardiac arrest could alert anybody vision blurred fell ground. Ray conference rushed Bob reached wallet find Health Information Card carried Unique Patient Identity (UPI) details. Every counted Bob’s breathing slowed sirens blared ears Ray could paramedics jump ambulance complete charts Bob’s previous medical records available against UPI Ray provided. As Ray climbed ambulance, saw paramedics started preliminary round treatment based real-time vital stats, past medical history, inputs a cardiologist remotely monitoring situation hospital. Bob safe.
 This technology achieve, empowering every healthcare provider make efforts save lives backed powerful insights data. This story could a tale present not. So, huge volumes data generated every step healthcare value chain enough advances technology explore varied data, stopping us using technology data-driven healthcare today?
 For industry data-driven main element decision-making – guessed right “Data” exactly problem lies. For a data-driven approach making complex decisions, imperative collect relevant, high quality, consistent reliable data utilized derive useful insights predict future outcomes high accuracy. Thus healthcare needs fully exploit data analytics needs develop strong capabilities – integration data multiple sources, capability build develop advanced analytical models lower error margins ability transform organization a breeding ground deep insights predictive prognosis right mindset inclined adopting transformation analytical models drive results.
 Data collection integration: Finding right data major challenge analytics project healthcare, major reason low adoption rates digital data capturing methods high data fragmentation.
 (a) Low adoption digital practices means healthcare providers rely manual modes data entry like notes oral recommendations convey a patient’s medical information. Despite technologically advanced countries Electronic Health Records (EHR) adoption rate 67% end May 2017. This dismal state analytics based limited information a good representation actual population. In developing countries, percentages disappointing low digitized data available lesser interoperability. Electronic Medical Records (EMR) prevalent EHR means Bob visited health provider apart Jacob high chances medical records available.
 Bob wears a Fitbit tracks activity levels sleep pattern details.
 He also uses MyFitnessPal app mobile keep a check calorie intake.
 He a regular social media user often posts day platforms.
 (b) With growth technologies like remote monitoring, wearables, social media analytics, etc. Bob a patient generating a lot real-time data wearable devices apps. His social media interactions analyzed using text analytics explore predict mental health issues. These considered major source data analytics. Clinical data like EHR EMR, monthly/ yearly credit card transactions used make medical payments, medical claim settlements, genetic databases, public records, major sources data analytics.
 This makes data sources fragmented difficult work due dissimilar syntaxes. Fragmented database seldom leads standardized good quality data. Also, every organization a different goal achieve data collects hence nature data captured different.
 (c) Bob a UPI made easy paramedics serve interest least turnaround time. No UPI unique identifier patient makes difficult integrate patient data different sources. Countries like Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden U.K advanced EHR capabilities achieve almost a 100% adoption rate high interoperability done employing UPIs.
 Organization mindset:
 Jacob faced a lot resistance nurses clinic announced introduction CPOE EHR machines entry data. The nurses earlier used manually write patient information felt threatened machines taken jobs. Resistance adoption technology due job reduction impacts skill gap adopt technology leading higher costs training.
 With huge volumes data generated threat security, standpoint needs addressed. Since healthcare entails a lot sensitive information patient a heightened risk thefts paramount identity theft. From 2014 2015, number individuals affected protected health information breaches increased approximately 1.8 million approximately 110 million US alone. Without a data governance structure place, patients would fear shun providers implementing e-entry data.
 Healthcare providers reluctant set standard data promote data interoperability standardization EMR data might make easier patients switch health providers. Thus, imposing barriers exit a convenient retain patient base turn restricts possibilities analytics a wide-scale implementation.  
 Advanced Analytics:
 The IBM Watson AI debacle inaccurate cancer predictions raised a important question whether machines trusted complex decisions? In a business cost failure a life value cannot monetized a lot stake. Analytical models need trained able make predictions higher recall possible training data quality data accurately defined past as-is situation
 Data ever-changing variables like regulatory changes, environmental factors, etc. change analytical model ways hence keeping data a big challenge.
 Deep learning models prediction act a black box clear understanding predicted outcome impacted input features. The program, named Deep Patient, trained using a large training dataset 700,000 individuals. Without expert intervention, discovered patterns data predicted people a wide range ailments, especially mental illnesses cancer a breakthrough. However, problem researchers yet sure able arrive results complete model a Blackbox. This might increase risk wrong diagnosis certainty scenario model might fail.
 The overcome challenges layout stronger data governance laws, ensure government regulations allow providers create barriers exit patients incentivize healthcare providers adopt digital transformation strategies. The Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act (HIPAA) a step right direction protect Patient Health Information (PHI) mandates providers set a compliant infrastructure threats against security. However, a long go fears health care providers patients electronic modes capturing data assuaged better capabilities capturing relevant data giving much-needed impetus analytics healthcare.
