 Have ever wondered what’s common Sir Alex Ferguson, Pep Guardiola, Jose Mourinho? know might look a lame question, especially ardent football followers. At instinct, answer regarded top managers football universe. #UCLwinners. But given a closer look, managers, weren’t great came careers football players. Any naïve observer build a fallacy causation correlation don’t a great career a football player go become a great football manager. But restricted football? Mike Brearley, greatest captains history cricket author book art captaincy, wasn’t prolific batsman time. Our former President, A P J Abdul Kalam didn’t a political background, appointed president country went become finest presidents country ever had. So, stated confidence great leaders need expert respective fields?
 Let’s understand leadership role, types leaders, explore a perspectives arrive a conclusion. 
 Let’s start understanding a leader. A leader a position a designation. It’s a virtue employed correctly. From a janitor CEO, a student a researcher, a content writer a philosopher everybody a leader. (#leadersareeverywhere) So, virtues a leader? One famous personality trait theories, Big 5 personality trait theory always linked closely leadership. As per various researches, personality traits extraversion, openness, conscientiousness associated leaders often traits. Not humble empathetic also considered adjectives frequently associated leaders. But nowhere technical expertise related a leader. #NOTSOTECHNICAL
 As stated Colin Powell Leadership art accomplishing science management says possible. #It’sART If leadership art leaders artists less leaders viewed directors films organizing, arranging, managing, directing scenes. Another analogy orchestra conductor using baton/stick set rhythm band. So, necessary conductor a great violinist? No. When comes corporate sector leader need expert technology know technology functions he/she utilize possible way. They allocate task building technology right technical experts. And leaders identify right person job? Or leaders know qualities look a person? #Experience. Every great leader started frontline workers bottom pyramid hierarchical structure. Even though might technical expertise respective fields, visionary outlook, management skills, experience gathered helped achieving targets. Leaders always take assistance subject matter experts guide situations technical difficulties. As per great man, situational trait theory leadership, leadership innate person. Leadership though conditioned brought a person rewarding him, great leaders show unconditional attachment towards vision. Everyone knows read a map, path choose isn’t something taught. Leaders give direction vision company drive closer target company wants achieve. Leadership theories don’t focus technical knowledge leaders, rather people skills, approach towards a problem, well guide hire others get job done, also evident per managerial skills required per Robert Katz.
 Though argued technical experts also great leaders areas, leaders generally middle management level. As per different leadership styles, a servant leader always tries achieve goal team. These leaders ones a management objective laid front drive team closer achieving target people-first mindset, a collaborative approach towards solving problem. These people leaders needed execution level project close employees bottom-most level. Since managers top pyramid don’t get much time invest people appoint right people behalf get job done.  
 Consider firm. So per points mentioned above, mean a leader manager shouldn’t know code? Depends. If person line manager probably know code help team achieving target producing less garbage might project’s KPIs. The project manager, might operations manager, (#MBA) background, probably need know line code written know algorithms logic behind code validate code client’s perspective. The CEO, might background know run firm rather syntax code.
 But today’s competitive world leaders can’t dimensional. They need expertise multiple areas top. Mike Brearley got a chance play a T20 match, won’t even get picked aside, age, great looking batting statistics(#Thegamehaschanged). His leadership skills won’t enough get squad. But a great leader selected coach top 15 captains world today. As already discussed film directors, job isn’t teach cameramen set operate (lens settings, etc) camera. Their job guide cameramen angle held coordinate lights crew a perfect shot captured. So even a leader a technical expert field, right approach mindset, understands system process, hire talent job get work done guiding talent, vision.
 So, answer question, came across paragraph, yes no. Depending upon position hierarchy (yes a front-line manager a CXO) type leader are, level technical expertise needed varies. Though stated earlier Robert Katz, CXO’s need least amount technical expertise, CXO know technology functions applications. What processes followed build technology.  He done rather done, (#itsnothowitswhat). Otherwise, even though company might sitting a gold mine If leader isn’t aware isn’t learned enough know it, company succeed even resources disposal. Leaders command respect don’t demand that’s possible give value front-line employees, seek timely advice technical experts, put resources uses. Otherwise, surrounded technical experts like dilberts.
