 From stone age modern world, hunting gathering cultivating crops, living caves building communities, come a long become evolved creature planet. So, thing a guiding force throughout process? believe simple words say: enhance experience life, words, boost productivity level. Once basic need food, cloth, shelter taken care of, want a comfortable life, good education, proper healthcare, list goes on. This urgency endless need pushed us make breakthrough inventions made human life comfortable productive. First, humans invented electricity, computers came, portable computing devices like laptops mobile phones became operative, artificial intelligence AI a buzzword. Every creation human beings transformed human life face planet. From living mud house building skyscrapers, riding a bullock cart flying aircraft, posting letters making video calls, computers AI Artificial intelligence yet another groundbreaking invention humankind, revolutionize lifestyle forever!

 So, Artificial Intelligence AI? We say simple words AI ability a computer program think learn rationally. It pattern recognition, analyzing images videos learning, natural language processing, understanding. It creating a technology can, cases, replace humans do. However, personally, crucial part definition AI application solve problems intelligently rationally using algorithms enables us computers find deep patterns even known exist. AI like a complex series layers algorithms create a neural network processes data information coming system derives knowledge it. AI a complicated broad concept, Machine Learning a subset AI, Deep Learning, a specialized subset Machine Learning.
 According a study PWC, $16 trillion GDP added 2030 based AI. The economic impact scale never seen before. And industry impacts virtually every industry aspect lives.
 So, question people around us using enigmatic technology?
 We use AI time. But mostly, unaware it. We use AI whenever type a search query a search engine. Every time use GPS whenever use voice recognition system. What artificial intelligence unlimited. Whenever anything technology, using form machine learning artificial intelligence. AI means different things different people. AI facilitating machines humans understand interact creating opportunities ways business. For example:
 A videogame designer use AI jot code affects bots play observe reaction.
 A data scientist use AI explore classify data fulfill specific goals. 
 Law enforcement agencies use AI identify criminals video feeds.

AI provide preliminary support make life a easier efficient. For example, world renounced scientist Stephen Hawkins lived life assistance AI technology. Likewise, paralyzed people AI a robot help basic day-to-day activities. For a blind person, AI work a personal assistant provide text-to-speech translation, writing assistance, support regular activities. Whether a person blind, deaf, paralyzed, doesn’t matter. AI a life-changing tool them.
 Boosting quality self-study: AI transform educational system completely. Just imagine would weren’t means online education pandemic lockdown? Our entire education would come a halt. believe post-pandemic, world shift online medium, work education. Other that, sometimes face difficulties self-study. Their artificial intelligence help understanding, explaining, providing correct information right time. Just imagine efficient a student’s life would a robot a tutor 24*7!
 Women Safety: AI enormous help providing safety, protection, security services.
 Personal Assistant: It would convenient us a Personal Assistant. People like us can’t afford keep a personal assistant a robot keep account daily work would convenient productive.
 Helping Hand Household Chores: Household chores essential factor impacts daily life. It a blessing every household a robot basics chores cleaning, cooking, washing, carrying heavy loads, repetitive jobs. It save a lot time, invest time productive creative activities.
