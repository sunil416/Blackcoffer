 1. The Problem
 Insider threat detection specifically detect data-exfiltration network a challenge. Existing perimeter security solutions end-system security effectively devised handle insider attack data exfiltration. Issues misconfiguration, vulnerable points, covert network channels lead data-exfiltration. Hence, building effective system detecting insider attacks remains open challenge. Devising exclusive behavior-based model essential detect data-exfiltration network utilizing parameters system network.
 2. Motivation
 Nowadays thousands companies organizations subject a cyber-attack. Many hackers exist outside a company organization hacking breaking information systems execute cyber-attacks. But nowadays insiders hackers exist inside a company organization becoming a big problem insiders often overloaded potential threats commit cyber-attack.
 Usually apply kind security policies access control policies aimed prevent data, business policy, product information, secret information, etc. sometimes fails, trust someone give him/her full access network, host, etc., usually try leak data information. This reason say, insider attacks often damaging costly due knowledge access information system. From recent survey done institutions researchers 2010 2011, know a quarter cyber-attacks done insiders.
 3. Insider Threat
 An insider threat a malicious hacker (also called a cracker a black hat) employee officer a business, institution, agency. Insider threats often disgruntled employees ex-employees believe business, institution, agency “done wrong” feel justified gaining revenge.
 It difficult detect prevent, attacks people legitimate access organization’s computers networks represent a growing problem digital world. These insider threats frustrate employers lack resources identify monitor behavior. Insiders employees: today include contractors, business partners, auditors… even alumnus a valid email address.
 Define insider a trusted entity given power violate a security policy. The insider determined reference established security policy. Insider threat lies access ability to: violate a security policy using legitimate access violate access control policy obtaining unauthorized access.
 4. Insider Type
 There different types insiders result information leakage: Inadvertent, Intentional Malicious. An inadvertent insider a trusted person access sensitive information inadvertently discloses sensitive information. An intentional insider a trusted person knowingly discloses sensitive information aware security purposefully bypassing. This person try manipulate content use overt communication preserves privacy avoid detection. A malicious insider also a trusted person knowingly discloses sensitive information. However, addition manipulating content using overt communication like international insider, tunneled covert communication usually employed avoid detection.
 5. Data-Exfiltration
 If talk terms general life, exfiltrate means surreptitiously move personnel material area enemy control. In terms computer science, data exfiltration unauthorized removal data a network. E.g. leakage archives, passwords, additional malware utilities, personally identifiable information, financial data, trade secrets, source code, intellectual property, etc. For a hacker, easy move things a box. E.g. RAR file, ZIP file, CAB file, etc. Data Exfiltration outbound FTP, HTTPS common days. Data-Exfiltration Network medium common. For example, FTP, HTTP, SMTP, SSH, INSTANT MESSENGER, ROOTKITS, BATNETS, SPYWARE, COVERT CHANNELS, PHISHING, PHARMING, MITM medium data-exfiltration quite simple insider. Exploits, Privilege escalation, DNS Poisoning, Directory traversal common attack done insider. If talk Physical medium data-exfiltration also play a major role. For example, printing device, CD, DVD, DISC, USP, LAPTOP, etc. common medium used insider data-exfiltration.
 6. The solution detecting Data – Exfiltration Network
 Presenting a behavior approach based a Chi-Square model detect insider attack specifically, data-exfiltration. The approach focuses technical well behavioral aspects present methods detect data-exfiltration. Firstly learning phase, profile host a network compute Chi-Square values individually system network parameters. Secondly, detection phase, compute Chi-Square values identified parameters superimpose current Chi-Square values learned Chi-Square values detect data-exfiltration network.
 Aim develop a method identify abnormal cyber behavior establishing user profiles based cyber data collected user active a computer. To this, implement learning algorithms establish “normal” behavioral profiles users. Monitor users anomalies behavior patterns. It important state goal identify abnormalities. For example, identify a user uploading abnormally large amount file a directory typically access.
