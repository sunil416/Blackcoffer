 We’ve really done year. Like insatiable glutton, law averages come home roost. We should’ve taken hint 1st January, 66 people lost lives Jakarta floods. What followed like highlights reel a disaster movie franchise – a volcanic eruption The Philippines, irrepressible bushfires Australia, earthquakes Russia, Iran, Turkey, India, China. And speaking China.
 2020 brought home fragile mortality human race sharp focus. As global Covid-19 deaths stoutly push past grim 1 million marks, choice question place universe – all-conquering masters domain, mere tourists a ruthlessly apathetic ecosystem? Is human race ubiquitous three-part literary arc defines every story, every life, every civilization – ascent, apex, descent? Maybe Michael Jackson unveiled moonwalk 1983, Barack Obama stepped White House President United States 2008, indeed MS Dhoni lifted Cricket World Cup 2011, peaked, a species, everything since a steady unraveling.
 500 years a long time. For context, world population 1500 AD a mere 461 million. The 16-fold explosion since unprecedented history, might tip iceberg. Though fertility rates dropping people foregoing chance babies, might crossed threshold – population projections year 2050 9.8 billion, 2100 a whopping 11.2 billion1. Somewhere there, Malthus cackling grave. The year 2500 suddenly seems a long off, conversation seems ever-more pertinent today. The Bulletin Atomic Scientists optimistic – famed Doomsday Clock maintain closest ‘midnight’ (our proximity global catastrophe), since inception 1947. Global warming? Check. The threat nuclear war? Check. Ongoing pandemic? Check, check, check.
 And yet, hope floats, reasons. Mankind back wall right now, shoots potential might help us make 2500 AD – advent a basket disruptive technologies (artificial intelligence, bio-enhancement, genetic engineering), private sector focus space exploration terraforming, good old fashioned human resilience. While factors doubt critical human survival, must pin hopes – long-demonstrated history surviving whatever nature, universe, self-destructive tendency, throws way.
 The Next Superman?
 In 13th century, Italian town Pisa, enterprising tinkerer developed eyeglasses, a local friar weakening eyesight2. All a sudden, existed external device could amplify senses, a tool gave us advantage survival. Today, LASIK surgeries obviate need eyeglasses entirely. Hearing aids give gift auditory perception back gotten used a world muffled voices unheard sounds. The iPhone routinely comes augmented reality tool allows us measure length objects front us.
 But real science starts imagination ends – augmented reality glasses, smart wearables, virtual reality tools ubiquitous next decades. But that? Science answer, it’s thrilling scary. Artificial intelligence become stuff fable, filler questions left unanswered. But AI, combined bio-enhancement genetic engineering, might lead evolution calling Homo nouveau3. Homo nouveau smarter, faster, agile, better equipped adapt promises a world VUCA beyond imaginations. What might a human look like?
 They might a small chip embedded brain utilizes artificial intelligence enhanced sensory perception. What mean? It means would able better, focuses attention longer, hears want hear, communicate appropriate reaction rest body. Through a chemical blood, AI chip would able demand appropriate response body. Bio-augmentation limbs organs, internal external, would mean a person cannot longer determined birth, simply bought. All a sudden, average Joe run faster Usain Bolt, swim better Michael Phelps, and…fly? Maybe. Genetic engineering missing link. Already feverish conversations a dystopian future featuring designer babies a digital divide simply cannot overcome inbuilt one’s DNA. The breakthrough CRISPR-Cas9 might key unlock mysteries DNA manipulation. So there’s food left? Our body AI adjust appetite accordingly. No water? Absorb humidity air specialized pores skin. The human 2500 AD recognize today. That shot.
 Galactic Dominance
 SpaceX, led mercurial leader Elon Musk, leader here. The SpaceX Mars Programme based a simple premise – earth’s closest planet terms distance terrestrial conditions, Mars would bet colonization. Musk invested billions dollars Mars Space Programme remains a fervent believer concept. And tech visionaries, Musk alone. Jeff Bezos, richest man world, owns Blue Origin, simply aims make spaceflight cheaper incremental technological growth. Bezos, took online retailer books turned ever-expanding behemoth, a man thinks small. With business leaders finding spaceflight planetary colonization a tantalizing prospect, inevitably a concerted push developing actual colony another planet. And pull-factor development starts hitting diminishing returns, inevitable push factor global warming possible increase eruption pandemics begin take toll. It might become a feasible option people find alternate home, Mars, Saturn’s moons.
 A human colony Mars sounds like a concept straight science fiction, a permanent station Antarctica a decades ago. Mount Everest seemed like unapproachable summit someone went ahead planted a flag peak. Today, hundreds people every year attempt climb. As spaceflight becomes reasonable, urge explore supersedes inertia investment, become closer chance survival – leaving planet earth behind finding another home, perhaps forgiving follies.
 The Human Spirit
 The introduction article includes illustrative list disasters misfortunes struck global community year. And yet, survive. Businesses surge ahead, people adapt a world masks social distancing, world goes on. Earthquakes, tsunamis, pandemics, we’ve seen survived, human race, intrepid exploration world, pushes onward upward. Technological visionaries envision a future rest us cannot see, invest money vision. Gradually, seemed unthinkable suddenly becomes real – moon landing possible example that. Google launched Google Glass augmented reality wearable technology, suddenly could foresee a future smart eyewear. While product didn’t quite catch on, doesn’t mean companies aren’t trying. Bio-augmentation already a fast-developing industry, CRISPR-Cas9, “genetic scissors” held back regulatory bottlenecks. How long prospect fiddling gene code becomes a luxury a necessity? The human spirit, tendency survive thrive costs, eventually win.
 The human race survive 2500, doubt. The real question is, person exists 2500, bionic chips a bio-enhanced body structure a modified genetic code, called a Homo sapien? Or Homo nouveau forward?
