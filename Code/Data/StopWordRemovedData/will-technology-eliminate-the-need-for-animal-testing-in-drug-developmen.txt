 Imagine a speak comprehend you. You kept captivity, a place hardly breathe. You finally selected taken place, a happy moment you. You finally freedom sadly instead free, prodded rods fed toxic substances against will. The thing scream vain. Your voice heard everyone gets lost noise scientific advancement. You writhe pain substances take effect body, pain slowly creeps body slowly succumb it, never wake again.  
 Since time Aristotle, animals subjected various inhumane experiments sake knowledge. These experiments though unethical necessary advancement science. Animal testing become important part experimenting living organisms ensure a product safe humans consume. The lab animals generally subjected high levels toxicity kept isolation due suffer a lot stress discomfort. Animal testing a large number drawbacks:
 Animals human beings react differently certain substances. For example, 2004, Vioxx withdrew “rofexocib” 80,000 people suffered heart attacks taking drug. Although drug showed effects animal testing, posed threat human beings. 
 It costly conduct animal testing animals need provided shelter food a large period trials completed. 
 Animal testing might lead a scientific breakthrough. There various instances animal testing failing achieve desired result ultimately leads loss time, resources money. 
 Some products like cosmetics essential humans therefore don’t require animal testing all. The cosmetic industry notorious animal testing products it’s a pity products aren’t even launched market.
 All things make us question ourselves. Is even worth it? Is possible stop cruelty without hampering growth?
 With advancement science, made possible don’t use animals ever again.  
 Advanced computing– With availability various software programs become easier understand working a biological organism. We replicate entire human body conduct various tests get generate simulations assess possible effects a chemical biological reaction. For example, CADD (Computer-aided drug design) becoming popular stimulating whether a particular drug affects cells not. This cuts requirement using animals testing also reduces experimentation time researchers don’t wait animals show response. 
 Tissue Culture – Growing tissues Petri dishes vitro cells a viable alternative animal testing. Tissues cells brain, liver, kidney etc. taken animal kept a suitable growth medium a weeks even a year. These cultures used test toxicity efficacy substances. For example: In eye irritancy tests, animals used experiment check substance irritating eye not. Many animals permanently lose eyesight using a animal every time simply inhumane. Using bovine corneal organ culture corneal tissue cultured weeks using yields result without complications. Scientists started use method test toxicity efficacy cosmetics, drugs chemical sectors. 
 3-D printing– Making complex tissue structures a single digital file astonishing. Printing tissues help carrying experiments getting results similar real tissues. For example Earlier animal organs, charts 3-D models used explain functioning a particular organ medical students bio-printing companies started making human tissues organs used students various medical schools understand intricacies human organs helped bringing animal experimentation a large extent.
 These bio-printed models also used researchers conduct experiments without using animals it. A French company working a bio-printed liver model test liver toxicity without use animals all. This a breakthrough field bio-technology bring animal experimentation a large percentage.   
 Organ-on-a-chip method – It a fairly technology consists growing cells inside chips imitate structure behavior human organs. Researchers test drugs chips far cheaper humane testing animals. For example, UK Company CN Bio come a system consists 10 organs a single chip tissues ranging liver brain.
 Micro dosing: Humans participate experiments injected small time doses constantly monitored imaging techniques gather information changes happening body. These tests replace certain tests animals help removing drug compounds don’t desired effect human body. For example, COVID-19 tests carried human volunteers given small doses vaccine kept constant surveillance. This helped researchers removing drugs desired effect human body thus also able remove animal testing processes.
 These alternatives help bringing animal experimentation a large extent. If science progress without harming animals go rather putting excruciating pain. We must protect animals much would living a world without them.
