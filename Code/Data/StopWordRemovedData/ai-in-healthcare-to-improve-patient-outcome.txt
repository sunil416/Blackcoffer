 By identifying molecular patterns associated disease status subtypes, gene expression, protein abundance levels, machine learning methods detect fatal diseases like cancer early stage. Machine Learning (ML) techniques focus mainly analyzing structured data, help clustering patients’ traits infer probability disease outcomes. Since patient traits mainly include masses data relating age, gender, disease history, disease-specific data like diagnostic imaging gene expressions, etc, ML extract features data inputs constructing data analytical algorithms.
 ML algorithms either supervised unsupervised. Unsupervised learning helps extracting features clustering similar features together leads early detection diseases. Clustering principal component analysis enable grouping clustering similar traits together used maximize minimize similarity patients within clusters. Since patient traits recorded multiple dimensions, genes, principal component analysis(PCA) creates apparatus reduce dimensions humans could done alone.
 Supervised learning considers outcomes subjects together traits, correlates inputs outputs predict probability getting a particular clinical event, expected value a disease level expected survival time, risk Down’s syndrome.
 Biomarker panels mostly used detect ovarian cancer, outperformed conventional statistical methods due machine learning. In addition this, use EHRs Bayesian networks, a part supervised machine learning algorithms, predict clinical outcomes mortality respectively.
 Unstructured data clinical notes texts converted machine-readable structured data help natural language processing(NLP). NLP works components: text processing classification.

 An image STAR surgery.
 Cloud computing healthcare helped retrieving sharing medical records safely a reduction maintenance costs. Through technology doctors various healthcare workers access detailed patient data helps speeding analysis ultimately leading better care form accurate information, medications, therapies.
 How It help Biomedical research?
 Since AI analyze literature beyond readability, used concise biomedical research. With help ML algorithms NLP, AI accelerate screening indexing biomedical research, ranking literature interest allows researchers formulate test scientific hypotheses far precisely quickly. Taking next level, AI systems like computational modelling assistant (CMA) helps researchers construct simulation models concepts mind. Such innovations majorly contributed topics tumour suppressor mechanisms protein-protein interaction information extraction.
 AI precision medicine
 Since precision medicine focuses healthcare interventions individuals groups patients based profile, various AI devices pave practice efficiently. With help ML, complex algorithms like large datasets used predict create optimal treatment strategy.
 Deep learning neural networks used process data healthcare apps keep a close watch patient’s emotional state, food intake, health monitoring. 
 “Omics” refers collective technologies help exploring roles, relationships various branches ending suffix “omics” genomics, proteomics, etc. Omics-based tests based machine learning algorithms help find correlations predict treatment responses, ultimately creating personalized treatments individual patients. 
 How helps psychology neuro patients
 For psychologists studying creativity,  AI promising classes experiments developing data structures programs exploring novel theories a horizon. Studies show  AI conduct therapy sessions, e-therapy sessions, assessments autonomously, also assisting human practitioners before, during, sessions. The Detection Computational Analysis Psychological Signal project uses ML, computer vision, NLP analyze language, physical gestures, social signals identify cues human distress. This ground-breaking technology assesses soldiers returning combat recognizes require mental health support. In future, combine data captured face-to-face interviews information sleeping, eating, online behaviours a complete patient view.
 Stroke identification
 Stroke another frequently occurring disease affects 500 million people worldwide. Thrombus,  vessel cerebral infarction major (about 85%) cause stroke occurrence. In recent years, AI techniques used numerous stroke-related studies early detection timely treatment along efficient outcome prediction help solve problem. With AI disposal, large amounts data rich information, complications real-life clinical questions addressed arena. Currently, ML algorithms- genetic fuzzy finite state machine PCA implemented build a model building solution. These include a human activity recognition stage a stroke onset detection stage. An alert stroke message activated a movement significantly different normal pattern recorded. ML methods applied neuroimaging data assist disease evaluation predicting stroke treatment diagnosis.
 Patient Monitoring
 Today, market AI-based patient monitoring impressive monetarily enticing. It evolving artificial sensors, smart technologies explores everything brain-computer interfaces nanorobotics. Companies smart-watches engaged people perform remote monitoring even “patients”. An obvious place start wearable embedded sensors, glucose monitors, pulse monitors, oximeters, ECG monitors. With patient monitoring becoming crucial, AI finds numerous applications chronic conditions, intensive care units, operating rooms, emergency rooms, cardiac wards timeless clinical decision-making measured seconds. More advances started gain traction like smart prosthetics implants. These play impeccable role patient management post-surgery rehabilitation. Demographics, laboratory results vital signs also used predict cardiac arrest, transfer intensive care unit, even death. In addition, interpretable machine-learning model assist anesthesiologists predicting hypoxaemia events surgery.
