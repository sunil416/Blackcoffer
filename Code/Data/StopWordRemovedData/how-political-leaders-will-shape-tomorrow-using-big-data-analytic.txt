 Good governance key growth progress country can’t achieved better policymaking also implementation ground level real-time leads overall development economy well society. Now policies made benefit society a whole policymakers responsibility implement decisions betterment people. Due emergence latest technologies like big data, effectiveness policies tracked easily a real-time collection data applying data analytics measure effect achieved not. For example, advent government initiatives like Digital India, infrastructure set government’s services made available deliver services online leveraging internet information technology. Political leaders several states India started adopting technologies real-time governance across state help better address analytical requirements facilitate state-level decision-making. For example, Andhra Pradesh government used digital technology every department launched real-time monitoring Chief Minister monitors performance department CM Office Real-Time Executive (CORE) dashboard data updated automatically. Another example state Odisha, LPG distribution center opened areas, needed LPG companies demand done using geospatial analytics. Also, not-for-profit development organizations like, Swaniti initiative working innovative projects analyzing data Indian government. They collect, analyze, visualize data, used design development programs. They partnered Andhra Pradesh CM’s office provide data insights agriculture helped design a seed dissemination program.
 So political leaders play important role providing effective governance leverage technologies. Adoption big data analytics play a major role overall development society. These political leaders take advantage power infrastructure respective areas use technology big data bring transparency accountability governance. There government institutions departments like Income-tax department use data analytics scan income expenditure patterns tax return filers use detect black money generation. Similarly, tools also used detect terror crime financing analyzing pattern transactions done respective accounts. As tax collection major source income government, strengthen department technologies counter tax evasion problems faced government trace loopholes system. Also, create a team data scientists several departments government keep track functions administrations everyone come lens performance check data-based results. Artificial Intelligence-based systems used fraud detection several government institutions hence act upon also within time avoid setbacks.
 Another example systems used extensively areas land property holding records detect fraud forging documents documents related properties paper-based, hence needs strengthened advanced big data analytics systems keep a proper track record. Also, used judicial system track number pending cases well important cases pending a long time yet resolved. Further, used tracking healthcare facilities monitoring performance artificial intelligence data analytics like quality treatment facilities offered people state-run hospitals whether government spending healthcare actually utilized effectively.
 Now, things achieved political leaders try inculcate data-driven decision-making practices processes. For this, first, need invest setting data warehouses data collected stored well bring data scientists work areas administration monitored real-time government function data-based results. As government spends lots money several schemes public welfare, effectiveness schemes plays a major role helping society also. Also, government partner several institutions well companies working fields provide solutions well collaborative research done find solutions real-world problems. Many political parties already used data analytics electoral campaign program understand voter stance a particular demographic campaigned accordingly, resulted a better outcome electoral results, example, 2014 Lok Sabha elections a prime example using data-driven techniques electoral campaigning. So political leaders also understand benefits using technologies decision making hence create infrastructure use a larger scale day-to-day governance, a lot work fast-tracked hence, ease administration also. Today, perhaps India owns largest data repository world gathered digitalization records purposes like Aadhaar Card, passports, pan card, Kisan credit card, etc. There a massive amount data government use positively a lot opportunities apply data improve citizens’ service experience government efficiency, especially delivery services common people.
 This also applied farming sector, whereby water demand predicted needy areas a higher reliance agriculture producing large amounts. Water supply problems also predicted. Data analytics used get farmers a better price agricultural produce producing crops higher expected demand avoiding crops higher failure probability. In education sector, used predict demand number schools, teachers, reading materials, etc. areas facilities reach performance also monitored respective district departments.
 So basically technologies a wide application major areas like healthcare, education, transportation, agriculture, etc. implemented lead positive results near future terms better governance. But needs done proper planning proper channels data security also a big concern a data warehouse huge challenge cybersecurity issues because, case data breach, data could affected might lead misuse data. So political parties could leverage technologies respective areas, benefit huge help achieving better governance well greater accountability people.
