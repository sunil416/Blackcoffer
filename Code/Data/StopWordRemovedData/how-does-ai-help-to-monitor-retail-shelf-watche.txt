 With increasing computing power data, potential value algorithms became higher. People companies saw possibilities embed smart systems companies drive strategy innovation. As power algorithms, computing, amounts data increased companies started increasing amount use cases. AI started become essential value. Companies saw systems could move closer customers, drive efficiency, enhance employee experience capability, automatize tasks, decrease costs improve revenue. But AI went lulls spikes became capable enabling benefits. At a certain point, general public gave AI machine learning a whole, stalled developments investments.
 AI uses computer vision deep learning achieve results. Computer vision incorporates neural networks help computers detect objects within shelf images classify accurately.
 Deep learning a area moving machine learning closer original goals: AI. In deep learning, a computer system fed a lot data, observes analyzes recognize emergent patterns trends, ultimately generating appropriate recommendations predictions.
 Deep learning applications, especially field computer vision, ready prime time. Recently, a neural network architecture won ImageNet challenge classifying a wide variety objects – like birds, ships, cats – correct categories accurately humans did.
 Back store shelf, even subtle differences objects, poor lighting, reflections, background clutter overcome powerful AI applications.
 Our tool recognizes products thousands possible retail items verifies placement according given planogram. This translates automation o shelf management activities, centralized monitoring shelf arrangement hundreds branches, validation product, license agreement suppliers.
 The use ML-powered analytics solutions help businesses forecast inventory demand high accuracy. Systems rely machine learning capable analyzing a multitude data points, finding subtle patterns (indicating changes customer preferences, behavior, satisfaction), non-obvious humans. What’s more, systems don’t require explicit programming machine learning models learn data. The data fed them, better handle deriving meaningful insights.
 Our system automate manual tasks like gap price scanning free staff help shoppers. It increases availability provides real-time, accurate alerts restock shelves faster ever increase on-shelf availability.it transform supply chain. Drive supply chain decisions real-time shelf data understand actual demand avoid inaccurate inventory management comply price promotions. Automatically detect mismatches shelf avoid customer frustration. Our system harmonize online offline channels. Optimize online order picking reflect real availability shopper make online order
 By system, implemented a supermarket, use application predict market price demand accordingly forecast demand take actions prior system also keep track expiry perishable products alerts change accordingly correct time. If product released market great demand, system try analyze placed store, If present store system report sales manager add products store a much reachable visible place buyers.
