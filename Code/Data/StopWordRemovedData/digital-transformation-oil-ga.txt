 Oil & Gas industry would impacted industries digital disruption. Traditionally industry requires high capital, operating costs workforce needs work unsafe conditions. Further unpredicted nature oil rigs, capacity rig huge capital invested makes attractive area potential emerging digital technologies. The industry changed barrels amount bytes too.
 Potential Areas Digital Technology
 It helps improve areas Manufacturing, operations , marketing servicing across various functions could never imagine using volumetric display, Affective computing, Data integration , Digital manufacturing, mixed reality, machine learning, LTE, high performance computing, personal analytics predictive analytics, cognitive technologies, deep learning, Artificial intelligence robots.
 The safety working conditions also improved.

 Across stages involved production oil gas industry, digital technology implemented:
 Exploration:
 Currently, standardized data, advanced algorithms use high-performance computers put operation analyzing visualization states. By augmenting visual cognition geoscientists using machine learning reveal geography right size existing portfolio including identifying sub-commercial, marginal resources reducing profitability locking significant capital. This creates a potential value means increasing certainty extraction rigs deeper commercial viability 2P reserves form 50% 1P reserves.
 Development:
 At present, distinct objective, proprietary tools lack standardized data creating a wide variety integration issues. By integrating analyzing using securely layered integrated frameworks analytics diverse drilling data using open source architecture capability saving costs $30 billion dollars upstream players annually. This helps breaking data silos finding digital RoI keep pace direction innovation intact.
 Production:
 The current standing continuity operations a legacy asset base explains less sensorized state operation. To break never-ending cycle upgrading retrofitting equipment existing fields without spending much attained sensorizing following a layered data generation strategy extend analysis a reservoir level. This results additional cash flow $20 billion apart cost savings equipment failure repair.
 Till date, capabilities digital technology explored developing roadmaps optimizing operating costs involved. However, still, a scope disruption digital technology given untapped landscape productive capital (PPE- Plant, Property, Equipment)
 The quality efficiency system dramatically increase employing IoT various phases results illustrated below:
 Effects using IoT Oil & Gas Industry
 Cyber-security:
 Another important area benefits cybersecurity oil & gas industry. This area a vulnerable posing threat nation. The cyber attack lead seepage sensitive information prove costly even lead a plant shutdown. With increase involvement digital technology, risk cyberterrorism also evolved might end industrial espionage disruption operations. Due increased risk, per reports ABI Research, oil gas companies planning spend $1.87 billion protection against cyber attack 2018. But, part rise risk due data-based linkages operations dealt help digital technology only. The data information rigs, refineries, headquarters encrypted end end safety ensured. Thus, a need approach deal issue cyber-security oil gas sector programmatically sustainably.
