 The coronavirus, also known COVID-19, a global public health emergency also a source significant regional increasingly global economic disruption. This impacts energy climate world ways. The economic downturn puts pressure global oil prices leading Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) consider cuts production. It hurts demand natural gas a time extremely low prices. It changes economic, energy, climate policymaking environment China, consequential energy consumers sources greenhouse gas emissions. And temporarily disrupted supply chains throughout energy industry, including renewable energy, a time supply chain connections China revaluated due ongoing tariff trade disputes. How consequential transformative changes energy sector climate efforts depend upon ultimate trajectory virus outbreak itself
 — Sarah Ladislaw, Senior Vice President Director, Energy Security Climate Change Program
 The energy sector already felt impacts coronavirus. The outbreak contributed a dampened demand oil, resulting plummeting oil prices production declines. As move forward, then, energy sector expects face headwinds: managing issues health emergency sectors face, simultaneously coping a low oil-price scenario, lower demand need shore revenue manage debt obligations.
                                IMPACT COVID-19 INDIAN ENERGY MARKETS
 In India, distribution utilities a lower tariff domestic agricultural consumers, sometimes even average cost supply, compared commercial industrial consumers. Table 1 provides electricity tariff rates Delhi selected consumer categories highlight differences. Thus, several distribution companies, lower tariff-paying consumers cross-subsidized commercial industrial consumers.

 Single point delivery supply Group Housing Societies 150 4.50
 Agriculture 125 1.50

 The COVID-19 lockdown led shut essential commercial activities across country. Approximately 1.3 billion citizens obliged remain within confines homes and, cases, allowed work home. Consequently, electricity demand industrial and, commercial customers reduced significantly residential demand expected increased. According Power System Operation Corporation India (POSOCO), The energy met March 16th, 2020 – considered a business-as-usual scenario – 3494 MU compared 3113 MU March 23rd, 2020 a day voluntary curfew. It reduced a range 2600-2800 MU March 25th March 31st, 2020. This trend illustrated Figure 1.

 Thus, firstly, a key risk COVID-19 pandemic already struggling distribution companies India arises loss revenues due reduction demand commercial industrial customers well inability cover cross-subsidies provided lower-tariff paying consumer. Secondly, utilities would also account expense comply ‘must buy’ commitments generators long-term power purchase agreements. The true full extent risk would known a quantitative analysis conducted crisis situation contained. Thirdly, operational level, distribution companies would account deviation demand supply patterns a temporal locational level. Finally, period, critical infrastructure electricity networks would run minimum employees.
 COVID-19 impact power market
 As seen Figure 1, trade wholesale power market comprises 4.3 percent total electricity transactions. However, transactions power exchanges grown last decade. The Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) seen a growth 2616 MU FY 2009 52,241 FY 2019.

 Until now, trade wholesale market market segments:
 1) Day-Ahead Market
  2) Term Ahead Market
  3) Renewable Energy Certificates
 4) Energy-saving certificates.
  Recently, Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) finalized regulations implementing real-time markets. This half-hourly market enable intra-day trade electricity, allowing adjustment generation consumption profile day. Before COVID-19 pandemic, announced CERC real-time market would operational April 1st, 2020. However, starting date delayed months June 1st, 2020. According media reports, due COVID-19 pandemic, required trials could completed. This delay real-time market implementation likely a serious, adverse impact Indian power market.
 Another impact COVID-19 pandemic power markets terms market dynamic. It observed a dip clearing volume market-clearing price, coincides gradually increasing shutdown measures taken government a response COVID-19 (See Figure 2). Thus, reduction demand due lockdown reflected volumes traded electricity market clearing price.
 Another point reference price clearing volume 2019. On March 22nd, 2020, day voluntary lockdown, clearing volume 97.05 GWh, clearing price 2195.48 ₹ /MWh. In comparison, day 2019, clearing volume 107.98 GWh, clearing price 2816.18 ₹ /MWh. From start lockdown, March 25nd April 1st 2020, average clearing volume 104.27 GWh compared 130.24 GWh 2019 period. Similarly, average market clearing price 2155.93 ₹ /MWh 2020 compared 3371.025 ₹ /MWh 2019 period.

 The lockdown resulted a shutdown industrial commercial establishments stoppage passenger railway services. This adversely impacted India electricity demand, given segments constitute 40% India electricity demand, a statement issued rating firm said.
 Further, segments account even greater percentage Discoms sales revenues given subsidizing segments. This apart, focus state governments healthcare relief measures, likelihood subsidy support Discoms getting deferred cannot ruled out, added.
 ICRA Ratings Group Head Senior Vice President – Corporate ratings Sabyasachi Majumdar said, “The lockdown imposed government likely adversely impact India electricity demand, demand expected decline 20-25% a year-on-year basis period lockdown. This would turn adversely impact revenues cash collections distribution utilities near term, especially given consumption decline high tariff paying industrial commercial consumers likely delays cash collections consumer segments. The revenue deficit Discoms estimated Rs. 130 billion per month, India basis. This would turn adversely impact liquidity profile Discoms, increase subsidy requirement, lead delays payments power generation transmission companies.”
  The power ministry Friday issued directors Central Electricity Regulatory Commission provide a moratorium months Discoms payments power generation transmission companies.
 The power ministry Friday issued directors Central Electricity Regulatory Commission provide a moratorium months Discoms payments power generation transmission companies requested state governments issue similar directions state electricity regulators.
 The power generation companies already suffering delays payments Discoms across majority states, payment due Rs 85000 crore November 2019 India level per data PRAAPTI portal.
 With COVID-19 lockdown accentuating delays payments, availability adequate liquidity buffer form debt service reserve undrawn working capital limits remains important a credit perspective.
 However, said relief measures a moratorium debt servicing a 3-month period notified Reserve Bank India expected moderation interest rate cycle would a source comfort near term. The timely approval moratorium boards banks financial institutions remains crucial.
 The revenues power generation companies long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) state distribution utilities (Discoms) protected provision capacity charges linked plant availability case thermal large hydropower projects “must-run” status case nuclear renewable power projects.
 Average monthly thermal PLF would dip 50-52% against 63% corresponding period previous year, due a considerable drop demand consequently, power generation companies especially without long-term PPAs would adversely impacted given weakening power tariffs short-term / power exchange market, said ICRA Ratings Sector Head & Vice President GirishkumarKadam.
  The under-construction renewable power projects well EPC manufacturing companies solar segment likely face execution delays disruption supply chain India labor availability, following lockdown. Given import dependency China sourcing PV modules, execution timelines ongoing solar projects likely affected delays delivery PV modules following outbreak COVID 19 China.
 This delay turn would increase pre-operative expenses overall project cost, turn would impact expected returns.
 In context, MNRE notified time extension provided renewable energy projects, impacted supply chain disruption due COVID outbreak, force majeure clause.
 “Given execution headwinds amid COVID 19 affecting Q1 FY2020-21 assuming normalcy thereafter, capacity addition wind solar segments together likely degrow 25%, thus estimated 8 GW against earlier estimates 11 GW FY2020-21,” said Kadam.
