 For majority us Indians, encounter Artificial Intelligence (AI) perhaps Arnold Schwarzenegger displayed undying machismo ‘The Terminator’. Unless AI & relating Technology Business, James Cameron perhaps person introduced AI Indian masses provided a reference AI capable of! Well, extremely entertaining way! The concept AI termed a Wine aged well. Much things would considered fantasies yesterday least comprehended today already a reality.
 The World aging hence percentage Working Population rapidly declining. But Population definitely Resources available. This specifically Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning play a pivotal role instrumental adapting latest Labor dynamics, increase overall Productivity, a competitive advantage ultimately help Survival!
 The timeline evolution Artificial Intelligence, sister areas illustrated graphic:

 The role Artificial Intelligence ease Human Life bring incremental changes processes involving Human life. The role Artificial Intelligence perhaps explained Andrew Ng, Co-founder Google Brain Coursera, online MOOC pioneer. He says “The industrial revolution freed humanity much repetitive physical drudgery; want AI free humanity repetitive mental drudgery, driving traffic.”
 The Automotive Industry perhaps Industry realize potential AI United States Japan, warhorses Automobiles post-WWII era perhaps Countries actually work towards realizing potential. The New Jersey factory General Motors Assembly lines host Automotive Arm. These Automotive Arm become a pre-requisite Assembly line. The car would taken 2 months build built within a day Automation. A complete AI based process would wonders. The weakness Achilles lied heels biggest weakness Automobile Industry Humans, species intends serve. The majority Car Accidents happen face earth a Human error cause. The Human error serve Invention Penicillin definitely help making Roads safer. That Driverless Cars come picture.
 Let us take example Uber (or Ola Didi Chuxing). What attributes lack factors prevent maximum monetization? The answer lies Drivers. Uber bore brunt misappropriating behaviors Drivers also seen Drivers unionizing get a bigger piece Pie. The scenario Uber moving completely Autonomous driving vehicles increases Safety System also helps maximizing Profits. Although a definite possibility future, take time get implemented till Level-5 Autonomy Vehicles rolled out.
 The Innovations Healthcare Industry often restricted digitizing ‘automating’ manual tasks make easier. The machines involved self-learning would Doctor’s Interpretation. But advent AI restructured Healthcare Industry. The next 20-30 years personalization Healthcare Industry. Diagnosis, Therapy, Diet, Treatment would require Doctors would taken care entirely Machines. Where value lie Companies this? Again cause effect diagram imagine. AI-powered Healthcare firms eliminate a large number middlemen often prone error. The majority deaths caused Cancer due failure detect early signs act it. This won’t case powers IBM Watson made available general public. There complaints even IBM charges a premium it. Not this, a doctor patient ratio 1:921, specifically serves India well. As solves problem Accessibility Quality. This synonymous recent success Reliance Jio, whose success attributed important parameter – Accessibility.
 One important problems Social Media giants face today users leaving platform staying long enough Platform. This find content uninteresting, irrelevant, even abuses threat privacy. These parameters important Social Media companies Revenue Models revolve around them.
 What Artificial Intelligence curate content a particular User according liking protect Privacy extent he/she demands. This will, turn, ensure Users continue use platform activity in-turn monetizes it. AI-powered companies apply machine learning techniques like logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, etc. help companies study buying behavior Customer extract maximum value them.
 Another major field Artificial Intelligence create a definite Value field Finance Wealth Management. The major problem Banks face today dealing non-performing Assets. What AI case factually accurately predict Credit Risk entity thus minimizing NPAs maximizing Profits. Other Problems people face sub-par returns Investments. Artificial Intelligence ensure a superior analysis will, turn, give a bit better advice Customers. This ensure elimination Human Emotional Volatility.
 Another impact AI field Fraud detection anomalies patterns studied detect fraud predict fraud. Paypal, US-based payment giant implemented AI detect predict fraud brought fraud rate 0.32% compared Industry average 1.32%.
 To summarize, Artificial Intelligence deliver real value reducing costs Human error, Human inefficiencies, Content Customization, increase production rate, efficient Decision making, maybe ways cannot comprehend today.
 One profound impacts Artificial Intelligence field Human Resources, Human Resource Management Hiring Processes. AI successful predicting candidate attributes thus making hiring process efficient. This ensures company onboard company-match candidates reduce future inefficiencies lag-ings. AI-powered hiring saves a ton recruiter hours thus saving time money. Besides AI capability achieve resource optimization achieve maximum efficiency productivity. AI also helps predicting capabilities employees map Learning path them. This in-line bigger company strategies assist developing future Leadership.
