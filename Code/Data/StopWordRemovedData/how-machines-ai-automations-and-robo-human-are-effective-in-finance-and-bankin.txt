 We hear day day amidst a technological revolution. But know really means?
 Before understand going impact us, let us discuss terms really mean.
 A technological revolution simply means a period better newer technologies replace others get job done faster better. We era rapid innovations machines compared humans.

 So, Machine Learning?
 Machine Learning basically application artificial intelligence electronic systems enable learn enhance without programmed humans. It evolution development computer programs access data use advance themselves. Whether know not, use machine learning-powered applications daily.
 Now, Artificial intelligence?
 At simplest form, artificial intelligence a field, combines computer science robust datasets, enable problem-solving. 
 In simple words, Artificial Intelligence technology facilitates machines perform human like behaviour.
 Just like every industry, machine learning playing role finance banking industry too. In cases a human would perform task performing calculations following process taught machine perform itself.
 Let us discuss a examples applications might come day day running a result machine learning industry:
 Portfolio Management
 Risk Underwriting
 Algorithmic Trading
 Fraud Detection
 Process Automation
 Customer onboarding
 Customer churn
 Decision Making
 Process Automation
 Portfolio Management
 In earlier days, investor would need consult a financial advisor understand his/her risk appetite advise accordingly.

 Risk Underwriting
 Underwriting core functions financial institutions especially banks insurance companies required underwrite risk customers loaning money insurance policies. These underwriting activities based trends thumb rules industrywide. The introduced machine learning able underwrite risks today a larger accurate scale.
 Algorithmic Trading
 Machine learning a mathematical model tracks market information, analyses massive data sources study market conditions simultaneously detect patterns used trading. This humanly impossible a fraction time. Algorithmic systems make millions trades daily, often known “high-frequency trading”. It highly believed deep learning playing role calibrating real-time trading decisions.
 Fraud Detection
 With increase use dependency computers financial transactions came data security risk. There ample amount valuable data stored online available create potential risk. Machine learning thus helped fraud detection detecting anomalies transactions flagging scrutiny based risk factors defined institutions. Fraud identification insurance claims, credit card payments, identity theft, account theft, areas fraud detection machine learning help in.
 Process Automation
 Process automation common applications machine learning finance. The technology helped replacing manual work, automate repetitive tasks avoid redundancy, a result, increase productivity. Machine learning benefitted organizations optimize costs, improve customer experiences, scale services. Some examples financial banking firms using process automation use chatbots, automated calls, paperwork automation, gamified employee training.
 Customer onboarding
 In highly competitive industry, customer acquisition customer onboarding process highly relevant building a good customer relationship. At stage, onboarding, a slight inconvenience delay act a barrier. Machine learning-enabled complete automation process financial banking institutions.
