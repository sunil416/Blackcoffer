Given importance retail food environment establishing sustaining healthy diets, interruptions specific aspects it, availability fresh vegetables, could a negative influence population health, already noted a source worry.
 Despite dominance national international supermarket chains, warehouse clubs, supercenters grocery retail, vegetables offered a number food retail settings. Fresh vegetable #vendors typically smaller community-oriented restaurant retail food outlets include chain independent grocery stores, greengrocers, storefront stands, street carts, even makeshift platforms dedicated sale fresh vegetables. Smaller community fresh vegetable vendors conduct business sides major streets storefronts played integral role food environment large urban centers New York City (NYC), particularly ethnic enclaves, despite fact fresh produce a significantly higher nutritional value fresh produce also purchased larger food retailers.
 Since COVID-19 pandemic began, fresh fruit vegetable vendors, notably street carts selling fresh vegetables cities across United States, including New York City, forced close owing a combination falling demand fear catching COVID-19. The importance fresh vegetable vendors varies neighborhood within cities. Furthermore, fresh vegetable vendors attract visitors interborough shoppers a variety cultural backgrounds Asian ones looking things available elsewhere city low prices.
 These fresh vegetable vendors, unlike larger, well-established grocery store vendors, financial infrastructure sustain shifts supply demand produced COVID-19 epidemic; consequently, danger closure modifications services greater vendors.
 In order assess impact COVID-19 pandemic services offered fresh vegetable vendors, surveillance #data pandemic’s inception required.
 After a days, vegetable dealers began venturing without explicit permission quickly harassed police. After a weeks, government relaxed limitations, allowing vital traders sell wares (due large part advocacy vendor organizations activist networks). However, cost business increased dramatically, vendors longer access wholesale markets suppliers, must spend travel expenditures owing city-imposed travel limitations. Furthermore, partial lockdown place, number buyers decreased, earnings. Perishable vegetables a shorter shelf life summer heat, thus vendors unable capitalize whatever produce have.
 Consider situation Delhi starting COVID 19. The state launched INR 5000 crore stimulus package 50 lakh vendors, realizing serious consequences loss livelihood. The targeted relief vendors a credit facility provide sellers initial working capital INR 10,000, enough. Instead credit, government consider changing a direct income benefit, a cash grant, help people start earning money a regular basis. The vendors require income support order resume work, repay loan unable so? Vendor organizations must step forth face ever-changing crises lobby vendors given resources need continue livelihoods. Vendor organizations could use following part advocacy agenda:
 Promotion vendors’ livelihoods, particularly selling non-essential goods: COVID-19 a particularly painful impact informal labourers, spent savings wages trying feed prolonged lockdown. Vendors must permitted restart peddling order survive, government take steps reopen marketplaces reintroduce vendors streets.
 Market reopening social distance hygiene mind: Delhi features a variety typically crowded markets, including weekly markets (for fresh food, cooked meals, necessary household items) daily markets sides highways. These markets need resume considering necessity social separation, government issue recommendations regard. In future, vending zones must planned social distancing mind, well adequate sanitary facilities (running water, washing stations toilets). For this, government collaborate Town Vending Committees (TVCs).
 Provide direct assistance tied existing registration requirements: When lockdown lifted vending starts, vendors home months require direct income benefits order return work. While government stimulus plan a positive step, falls short terms assistance (credit rather direct cash transfer) eligibility (only registered vendors eligible, leaves majority vendors country). Furthermore, government assistance support must divorced country’s strict registration requirements, a vendors registered India. Only 131,00 Delhi’s 300,000 street sellers type employment identity. If state requires occupational identity type monetary grant livelihood assistance, government accept registration a workers’ organization/union a surrogate government-issued vending passes.
 Providing flowing water soap/sanitizers street sellers place business: The government take steps provide street vendors running water soap/sanitizers place business. Additionally, vendor organizations collaborate local food safety authorities instruct vendors (particularly selling prepared foods) maintain hygiene job.

The Town Vending Committees (TVCs) expected begin surveying registering vendors crisis ensuing lockout. As adjust normal, survey registration procedure begin guarantee vendors access social security benefits financial assistance difficult time.
 Finally, fresh vegetable sellers shuttered a period time early epidemic, reopen recently. Alternatively, vendors launched in-person checks completed, within June-July 2020 endpoint timeframe.
