 According Jack Welch (legendary CEO), “People related decisions a huge impact organization’s success failure”. Traditionally decisions largely based intuitions biases a use data analytics tools inform decisions manage people. Big companies like Teach America Google adopted technique started using workplace data build better employees. Professional sports ahead almost entire non-sports world using tools whole existence based performance individuals.
 Hard data used make soft-skill decisions hiring talent development. It done basis performance evaluation figuring hard people working based analyzing outcomes tend judge people outcome process fundamental challenge a range outcomes occur due factors outside employee’s control. So a challenge, separating skill luck. For instance, performance measure pretty high good outcomes scale, quite confident high effort. But also a low effort favorable environmental factors resulted a good outcome a consequence. Unless they’re a similar situation, difficult compare another. These type situation need a detailed analysis drive business performance. Also this, try test people based persistence level skills persist, chance doesn’t persist.
 Regression mean also method suggested Wharton’s top professors. For instance, sample, say, a person’s running speed look language ability is. The fastest runners, almost definition, necessarily people language ability. But that’s there’s inverse relationship language running ability. It’s traits simply imperfectly correlated sample extreme expect regression mean attribute.
 It important choose sample data, especially small samples. For instance, likely dramatically higher percentage boys girls vice-versa, born given day? A smaller larger hospital? The small hospital, of-course could large variations might girls day, boys another day a small hospital. There’s a larger hospital. This means careful follow intuition means look small sample might true representation whole data. So a place data make big difference opposed relying intuition.
 To predict something, a higher number people involved process get a number judgments. Higher number judgments lead a higher chance coming close truth idiosyncratic errors. But based a condition opinions independent. Because case not, would equal a small group people giving judgments. So data analysis helps making better decisions.
 Hiring right people also effectively done by:
 Job knowledge tests
 Cognitive ability tests
 Structured interviews
 Personality tests (personality test specially used retail sector skill set requirement varies based market type)
 Recently, India’s largest power producer, NTPC, rolled a basket initiatives employees seeks reposition HR function align fast-changing environment.
 Also according a recent study professional network LinkedIn, Analytics specialists high demand HR roles increasing number companies turning analytics past 5 years. So, things indicate people analytics a useful tool drive business performance.
