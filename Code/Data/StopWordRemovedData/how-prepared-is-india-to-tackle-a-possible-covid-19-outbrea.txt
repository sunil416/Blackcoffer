 Frankly, no! The state public healthcare system, vast, fragmented cannot scale rapidly enough face challenge a pandemic COVID-19. The origin public healthcare lies British colonial period facilities provided British officers families stationed India. From 1960s onwards, independent government India stressed upon healthcare led creation modern public healthcare system India. The healthcare system organized primary, secondary, tertiary levels. At primary level Sub Centre’s Primary Health Centre’s (PHCs). At secondary level Community Health Centre’s (CHCs) smaller Sub-District hospitals. Finally, top level public care provided government tertiary level, consists Medical Colleges District/General Hospitals. The number PHCs, CHCs, Sub Centre’s, District Hospitals increased past years, although standards set Indian Public Health Standards. But critical challenges existing system.
 One major areas lack awareness diseases, especially communicable diseases general population India. This challenge becomes complicated lower strata society, especially poor households, migrant laborers homeless people proper channels communication available get necessary information health experts. Add low educational status, poor functional literacy, low accent education within healthcare system, low priority health population, others magnitude problem. According a recent study initiated faculty students IIT-Hyderabad IIT-Bombay, Tier-1 cities, found 12 percent respondents switched public private mode week COVID-19. This modal shift 9 percent Tier-2 cities 7 percent Tier-3 cities. Moreover, nearly 48 percent people said travel work week March, whereas 28 percent frequency travel work. When inquired cancellation trips cities using major modes transportation, around 18 percent said cancelled flights whereas, 20 per cent respondents cancelled train journeys. This indicates awareness COVID-19 higher Tier-1 cities, comparison Tier-2 Tier-3 cities. But national level, state level door-to-door campaigns along targeted media campaigns enable knowledge pandemic spread fast local populace.
 The challenge access public healthcare India. Access (to healthcare) defined Oxford dictionary “The right opportunity use benefit (healthcare)” Physical reach basic determinants access, defined “ ability enter a healthcare facility within 5 km place residence work”. Using definition, a study India 2012 found rural areas, 37% people able access IP facilities within a 5 km distance, 68% able access out-patient facilities. Furthermore, postulated general, rustic (rural) one’s existence – lives towns – greater odds disease, malnourishment, weakness, premature death.
 The planning portion related preparedness pandemic. Planning a pandemic COVID-19 never done extensively India recent history a communicable disease spreads rapidly crowded locations, a quarter population live in. The recent national lockdown called led increase police violence sensitized deal a crisis humanitarian crisis facing migrant laborers, important part Indian economy, lost jobs facing a lack public transport, force walk thousands miles reach native villages. The ongoing slump economy exacerbated pandemic resultant lockdown. And growing complaints healthcare professionals, fighting front pandemic, lack Protective Personal Equipment’s (PPE’s) protect patients COVID-19. The lockdown hit HIV+ chronic patients hard need constant medication maintain fragile condition. Elderly people, often alone medical conditions, left without essential support. Ironically, group people immediate threat COVID-19.
 optimistically hoping, based ingenious creativity citizens, tide tough times fundamental changes healthcare system made sober learning experience prevent a repeat happening today.
