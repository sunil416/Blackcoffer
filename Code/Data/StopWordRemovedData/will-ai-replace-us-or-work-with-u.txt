 “Machine intelligence last invention humanity ever need make”
 Nick Bostrom
 To put frankly, Artificial Intelligence eventually replace jobs. Workers a variety industries, healthcare agriculture manufacturing, expect witness hiring disruptions a result Artificial Intelligence.
 If history taught us anything, disruptive paradigm-shifting business ideas make a fortune innovators, also build groundwork business models, market entrants, job opportunities inevitably follow. It true robots today future eventually replace humans jobs, innovative farming equipment humans horses industrial revolution. But mean jobs humans end here. We, hand, required generate provide value whole ways entirely business models a result changes.
 According 71% businesses worldwide, Artificial Intelligence help people overcome critical challenging problems live better lives. Artificial Intelligence consultants work equally fair, according a whopping 83% corporate leaders. These results demonstrate Artificial Intelligence steadily extending measures, yielding societal benefits allowing citizens live fulfilling lives.
 Increase Automation Jobs humans can’t compete
 Since advent Industry 4.0, businesses moving a fast pace towards automation, type industry. In 2013, researchers oxford university a study future work. They concluded almost every jobs a high risk automated machines. Machine learning responsible disruption. It powerful branch artificial intelligence. It allows machines learn data mimic things humans do.
 A research conducted employees Kaggle wherein algorithm created take images a human eye diagnose eye disease known diabetic retinopathy. Here, winning algorithm could match diagnosis given human ophthalmologists. Another study conducted wherein algorithm created grade high school essays. Here too, winning algorithm could match grade given human teachers.
 Thus, safely conclude given right data, machines easily outperform human beings tasks like these. A teacher might read 10,000 essays a 40-year career; ophthalmologist might 50,000 eyes a machine read a million essays a million eyes within minutes.
 Thus, convenient conclude chance competing machines frequent, high volume tasks. 
 Tasks machines don’t work
 But tasks human beings upper hand, is, novel tasks. Machines can’t handle things haven’t seen times before. The fundamental rule machine learning learns large volumes past data. But humans don’t; ability seemingly connecting disparate threads solve problems haven’t seen before. 
 Percy Spencer a physicist working radar world war 2 noticed magnetron melting chocolate bar. Here, able connect understanding electromagnetic radiation knowledge cooking order invent microwave oven. Now sort cross pollination happens us several times a day. Thus, machines cannot compete us comes tackling novel situations. 
 Now know around 92% talented professionals believe soft skills human interactions fostering relationships matter much hard skills successful managing a workplace. Perhaps, kind tasks machines never compete humans at. 
 Also, creative tasks: copy behind a marketing campaign needs grab customers’ attention stand crowd. Business strategy means finding gaps market accordingly working them. Since machines cannot outperform humans novel tasks, humans would creating campaigns strategies. 
 Human contact would essential care-giving educational-related work responsibilities, technology would take a backseat. Health screenings customer service face-to-face communication would advocate human contact, Artificial Intelligence playing a supporting role. 
 So, mean future work? The future state single job lies answer single question: extent job reducible tackling frequent high-volume tasks extent involve tackling novel situations?
 Today machines diagnose diseases grade exam papers, coming years they’re going conduct audits, they’re going read boilerplate legal contracts. But mean we’re going needing accountants lawyers? Wrong. We’re going need complex tax structuring, path breaking litigation. It get tougher get jobs machine learning shrink ranks. 
 Amazon recruited 100,000 robots warehouses help move goods products around effectively, warehouse workforce expanded 80,000 people. Humans pick pack goods (Amazon 480,000,000 products “shelves”), robots move orders throughout enormous warehouses, therefore reducing “the amount walking required workers, making Amazon pickers efficient less exhausted.” Furthermore, Amazon longer requires aisle space humans, robots enable Amazon pack shelves together like cars rush-hour traffic.” More inventory roof offers better selection customers, a higher density shelf space equals inventory roof.
 Kodak Vs Instagram
 Kodak, undisputed giant photography industry, a 90% share USA market 1976, 1984, employing 1,45,000 people. But year 2012, a net worth negative $1 billion declare bankruptcy. Why? Because failed predict importance exponential trends comes technology. On hand, Instagram, a digital photography company started 2012 13 employees later sold Facebook $1 billion. This ironic Kodak pioneered digital photography actually invented digital camera unfortunately thought a mere product didn’t pay attention towards created problem.  
 We live era artificial intelligence (AI), given us tremendous computing power, storage space, information access. We given spinning wheel first, electricity second, computers industrial revolution exponential growth technology.
 Airbnb breakthrough idea!
 Airbnb, a giant start-up known enabling homeowners rent homes couches travellers, example, “is creating a Artificial Intelligence system empower designers product engineers literally take ideas drawing board convert actual products almost instantly.” This might a significant breakthrough whether you’re a designer, engineer, type technologist.
 Differences Automation brings onto table: 
 There key changes automation bring macro level: 
 Changes capability demand
 Gender imbalance workforce redeployment
 Firm reorganization. 
 Sectors might trouble
 Artificial Intelligence isn’t a fad. Tractica, a market research firm, published a report 2016 predicted “annual global revenue artificial intelligence products services expand 643.7 million 2016 $36.8 billion 2025, a 57-fold increase time span.” As a result, industry’s fastest-growing segment size.”
 The reduction need people a result Artificial Intelligence related technologies, resulted job layoffs, a cause fear. In India alone, job losses sector reportedly reached 1,000 last year, owing integration advanced technologies like artificial intelligence machine learning. 
 Most companies Infosys, Wipro, TCS, Cognizant reduced employee base India recruiting less, engaging personnel United States investing heavily “centres innovation.” Artificial Intelligence data science, currently trending aspects require fewer people primarily located abroad, aren’t helping prospects local employees. Another factor computer industry continuously growing would develop a size million workers. Unfortunately, it’s a drop bucket compared robots Information Technology’s less-skilled brothers. 
 Large e-commerce sites used operated armies people manned 200 robots produced GreyOrange, Indian company based Gurgaon. These indefatigable robots lift stack boxes 24 hours a day, a 30-minute break recharging, cut employees 80%. For efficiency, a victory a disaster job prospects. 
 Concluding remarks
 Internal re-skilling redeployment staff a critical requirement hour. Artificial intelligence presented Indian policymakers epistemological, scientific, ethical issues. This requires us abandon regular, linear, non-disruptive mental patterns. The tale artificial intelligence’s influence individuals occupations told time. It us upskill look ways stay current industry’s current trends demands. 
 So, machines able take jobs? The answer a resounding yes. However, every job taken robots, equal number positions available people do. Some human vocations artistic nature. Others necessitate humans honing superhuman cognitive abilities. Humans machines form symbiotic relationships, assisting best. In future, people machines able collaborate work together towards a common goal business work for.
