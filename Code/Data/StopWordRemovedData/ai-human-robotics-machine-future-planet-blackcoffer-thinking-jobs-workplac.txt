 It’s year 2060. An automaton a Research Laboratory says a Scientist, “Warning! Error Occurred Reformatting Hard Disk Now!” The scientist panics. Automaton says again,” Ha! Ha! Just Kidding! “.
 Funny Right. Before say joke isn’t realistic, “How Automaton tell a joke?” But tell 2017, “Sofia” robot made a joke show Good Morning Britain! Who thought computers could tell us a joke? Hard believe? Well, idea giving computers human-enjoy thinking become a reality. Thanks technological advancement AI last decade.
 Before diving deep AI impact future work, let’s begin simple question: what’s AI? Artificial Intelligence provides machines power think data. The machine uses patterns trends found data makes decision, cannot create thought beyond patterns trends.

 With rise AI, humans divided question. Are machines human’s friend foe? Tech executives politicians conference stages, campaign rallies, even science fiction Hollywood movies like Carbon Black, Westworld, Minority Report, Ex Machina given take question. Some believe AI help us solve problems others believe rise AI result destruction maybe end world, know.
 Stephen Hawking made secret concern rise superhuman AI eventually would escape earth a planet. No, isn’t a plot Black Mirror. Right now, Superhumans a reality, AI is.
 “Homo Deus”, emergence Digital God using AI. God must also worry, AI might take job.
 Here’s Career Advice, thought a Robot? The fear AI would automate jobs future eventually leaving humans jobless daunting workers today. Statistics show nearly 37% workers worry losing jobs robots. While another thought people believe though rise AI result automating jobs future, however, also create millions job opportunities.
 AI already replacing manual repetitive tasks. For example, buying a metro ticket a movie ticket almost a human-less interaction. Each year number industrial robot jobs increases 14 %. At rate, it’s predicted 20 million jobs manufacturing industry replaced robots due automation.
 The coronavirus pandemic recession boosted demand automation. The Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Software industry experienced increase 19.53% year 2021. Coronavirus pandemic increased interest technology reduces human contact minimal making workplaces safe.
 Our workplaces look much different next ten years. AI help humans simplifying repetitive processes. The important catalysts future work D’s- Digitization Datafication. Digitalization converting data digital formats (computer-readable). For example, text Html, analog video YouTube video. Digitization helps increasing data exponentially. Datafication quantifying human life data improving data-driven business model. By 2025, forecasted digital transformation space build a $3,294 billion industry!
 One thing clear, data, future work. What find future data future work go hand hand. The total volume data datasphere created, captured, copied, consumed world predicted reach 175 zettabytes 2025. To give a much better picture understanding, represent digital universe stacks tablets, would 27.25 stacks earth moon.
 It’s time prepare data-dominated future Industry 4.0/Fourth Industrial Revolution begun. So, let’s artificial intelligence affect following fields:
 Human Resource: Nowadays, recruiters use AI-powered tools hiring workers. Using tools, recruiters get insights a candidate’s skills, personality even check whether candidate fit organization.

Roles focus complex decisions like resolving disputes within a department continue a human endeavor.
 Finance Accounting: In 2015, a report Accenture named “Finance 2020: death digital” predicted 40 percent transactional accounting work would automated 2020. Has technology replaced human factor? Well, AI created jobs involving managing AI system using information create insights. For example, accounting software already automated bookkeeping tasks used done humans, that’s opened door former bookkeepers learn skills needed run manage software employers clients. Advisors another crucial role accounting finance team. Using information gained transactions books, team creates insights improve business strategy.

 Engineering: Technology changing a blink eye. The technologies used years ago industry become obsolete today. Engineers keep technological advancements keep upgrading skills stay relevant industry. Learning work alongside machines designing work interaction better humans machines better going important skills engineers future.

 In 18th 19th centuries, rise industrial revolution centuries led millions people losing jobs scientific advancements. But also ended creating millions jobs. Statisticians said, automation destroys jobs, people find ones. Thus, AI holds a optimistic picture future.
 In future, AI going replace humans, rather make jobs humane. AI disrupt millions middle entry-level jobs next years also create millions additional jobs help boost economies.
