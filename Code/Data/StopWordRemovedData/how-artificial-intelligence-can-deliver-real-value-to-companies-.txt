 What Artificial Intelligence?
 Today talk a lot artificial intelligence change future. But don’t know actually means. Let us artificial intelligence.
 Artificial Intelligence coined 1950s a task performed a machine intelligence a human use complete task. In layman language, acts a situation manner a human would act. If human answer a question a conversation, would AI can. It analyses information makes future decisions, a human would.
 AI basically works algorithm. It uses a computers intellect solve problem quicker accurate a human can. AI mostly consists statistical information find trends patterns data. AI perform various functions like analyzing, planning, problem-solving learning. Another part AI Machine Learning, gathers information, learns adapts accumulates data.
 Stages Artificial Intelligence
 The artificial intelligence consists main stages.
 Artificial Narrow Intelligence:
 This stage AI functions narrowly. It functions like infant baby covers functional area. ANI used manner use a reparative manner. It cost saving need hire human pay a monthly weekly basis.
 Artificial General Intelligence:
 This stage biggest achievement entire humanity covers a broad area technological space. Humans finally constructed a machine think also reasoning ability. With AGI, machines ability similar humans. Machines become capable things performed humans. AGI working governments organizations problem-solving abstract thinking also. However, evolution take time replace abilities a human work parallelly him. But humans sustain?
 Artificial Super Intelligence:
 ASI final stage artificial intelligence predicted scientists machines automate tasks average human intelligence used. If AI reaches stage discover mysteries universe also able solve problems discovered mankind right now.
 How AI building a Business Model?
 AI narrowed gap businesses technology, reduced burden tasks skilled individuals helped easing decision making processes. The traditional methods, solving precise, specific repetitive problems reduced business technology user tool. AI’s powerful reasoning contextualizing ability making businesses proactive forecasts solutions.
 Traditionally a business model forcing humans define rules machines follow, AI derived rules data provided it. This led businesses taking less time ask questions time act answers. The time skilled labor used take modifying tools ensure inferences correct, time spent working proactively solutions businesses. AI replace workers AI add value skills leverage businesses.
 The self-healing adaptable power AI programs help management stop worrying logistics data start thinking ways leverage power discover areas impossible explore less time insufficient information.
 In today’s technological world businesses shift reliance human decisions, less forecasting errors necessities subjective management calls help organizations improved ability predict respond accurately customer clients’ needs.
 How AI revolutionizing areas Business?
 Artificial Intelligence limited top multinationals anymore, a lot rapidly growing Small Medium Enterprises (SME) entering AI market. It predicted research firm Spiceworks around 30% businesses embrace AI end 2018, increase 13% 2017. Rapidly growing AI-based technologies driving development nearly every sector. As move ahead, AI make sure businesses incorporated areas.
 Marketing
 Machine learning algorithms predict accurate results humans. The ability artificial intelligence analyze data increase sales lucrative features marketing firms using. AI algorithm drive a large volume user data find trends patterns, revolutionize ways companies effective marketing help leverage content strategy. A recent Harvard report shown analyzing chat logs words phrases build successful sales much 54%.
 Search engines like Google trends help capturing trends a particular product category times help keywords. Social media activity provide AI algorithms like Amazon’s recommendation system enough user data analyze purchasing trends individual users. Jeff Wilke, CEO Amazon worldwide consumer, uses behavioral-tracking AI algorithms place traditional memory-based marketing algorithms. AI help companies pricing strategies- AI track price trends a product category higher profit margins.
 Human Resource Applications
 Machine learning algorithms automate various tasks human workers, freeing time, resources money businesses. While critiques say a start robots taking humans loss jobs humans, businesses tend towards a practical view.
 AI a perfect complement human resources a company. The technology reduce burden administrative functions a company, allowing workers focus creative engaging work essential areas. According Richard Branson, companies must empower people make spot decisions think feet. Employees efforts talent used efficiently freeing traditional tasks.
 Emotional Analysis
 Human emotions complex measure AI, technology surprised everyone application called ‘Emotional Analysis’. The use surveys, social media, image recognition software lots techniques, AI algorithms dedicated completely analyze human perspectives a host topics reliability.
 The emotional analysis enable companies predict consumer behavior. The emotional analysis technology used PM Narendra Modi’s election campaign judge people’s opinion towards policies UPA government. Using AI algorithms, companies decide marketing campaign a changing market.
 Business Operations Efficiency
 Daily operations a business improved help AI algorithms, resulting higher growth business. AI algorithms analyze areas supply chain workflows identify improvements business. A streamlined workflow result effective utilization company’s resources reduce costs due low response time, maintenance redundancy minimized.
 With AI place, manufacturing firms streamline daily operations. Forbes magazine reported integration AI production capacity rose 20 percent a drop materials used manufacturing operations 4 percent, improving business operational efficiency.
 Artificial Intelligence Tools
 Before making investment AI algorithm, necessary companies tools required better functioning AI algorithms. Proper estimation internet speed must done type professionals required additional cost incur future.
 For optimum use AI, necessary hire a data scientist integrate business. A large number companies making user-friendly AI tools entrepreneurs Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs). One examples AI-powered application called Grammarly helping businesses consistent, high-quality writing across company’s brand, a tool called Legal Robot helping companies developing clear compliant contracts legal documents.
 A number companies using predesigned chatbots customer services employee training programs. AI-powered chatbots improved natural language processing a large extent, leading utilizing customer services. The use chatbots reduced response times human service agents.
 Conclusion
 Although machine learning artificial intelligence incorporated businesses, full potential explored. AI although used organizations nascent stage take time develop full potential. Early adoption AI help companies sustain predicting trends taking corrective actions. The limitless applications AI provide companies opportunities innovate differentiated competition.
