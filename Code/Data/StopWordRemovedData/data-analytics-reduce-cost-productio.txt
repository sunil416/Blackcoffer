 Data Analytics a tool reduce cost production Oil & Gas
 Oil & Gas sector core industries India play important role influencing decision making sections economy. The government taken steps keeping mind increasing demand oil gas, government allowed 100 percent Foreign Direct Investment sectors including natural gas, petroleum more, attracted foreign domestic investors like Reliance Industries Ltd Cairn India.
 Companies oil gas business also aim achieve similar goals industries producing product low cost selling higher cost making good profits, oil gas companies owner quite challenging, finding producing gas petroleum expensive. As oil gas industry working hard meet global demand energy, challenges industry faces a major external challenge face environment upstream industry operates. Like always challenges come opportunity, opportunity upstream industry reshape operations work reservoir refinery, using Big data Analytics, companies using techniques help optimize operations reducing cost increasing productivity thereby helping making profits. A recent study Kimberly firm, found offshore oil gas industries lose $49 million annually due unplanned downtime companies it’s $88 million, using big data analytics companies save 20% capital expenditure cut upstream cost 3-5%. A study Bain & Company indicates harnessing Big Data analytics oil gas industry could help improve production 6% 8%. Better data analytics improve ability find product, reduce cost development production, make energy affordable safer extract.
 The operator incorporate big data solutions using Retrofits equipment sensor, a fast payoff terms reducing maintenance cost increasing reliability. Connecting cloud, using Asset Performance Management (APM) software powered GE’s Predix a suite software connects upstream assets digital world, using software companies get informative data sensors, help improve operations, effectively help reducing cost production. IOT PREDICTIVE BIG DATA ANALYSIS used oil gas sector maintaining making proper models easy optimized, software like LAS log analytics used HDP big data analytics oil gas allows scientists ingest query disparate LAS data use predictive models. They leveraging existing statistical tools SAS R build models rapidly iterate billions measurements. Combining LAS data production, lease, treatment data increase production margins.
 The statistical tool like SAS efficient oil gas industry; it’s used planning production every stage, countering risk cost inherent oilfield exploration Improving reserve exploration strategies. It help finding uncover hidden patterns data revealing connection evident linking data other. SAS help Seeing full picture adopting a data integration platform aggregates data exploration, drilling, completion, reservoir, production more, helping taking right decision optimizing production reducing cost.
 There technologies available help saving time cost Real-Time Data, real-time data focus drive better insight data quicker ever real time.
 Real-Time data well site help reducing decision latency curve (Source: Mobilize).
 Leading Oil & Gas companies already begun projects using Big Data technologies. Which helping track business opportunities, reduce costs increase production.
 By recognizing value unexploited data assets supporting fact-based decision making, Oil & Gas companies establish real cases Big Data uses. So enhance Business value based innovation able lead towards a sustainable competition.
 Over coming years, industry defined take advantage digital analytics evolve. Investing help digital deliver better efficiency productivity, brighter future industry.
