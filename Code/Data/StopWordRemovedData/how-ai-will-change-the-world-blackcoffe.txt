 Abstract
 The work done destined undergo massive transformational changes impact humans ways working dramatically. With development machine programs, A.I. set take humans workplace did. Now competition beings robots too. And robots overcome us fields work.
 At present surrounded A.I. dusk till dawn, facial recognition present mobile application dating websites/applications uses decision making algorithms learn past data well. It believed A.I. grown 270% last years.
 First, let us know A.I. fuss going it?
 A.I. defined internet simply ‘simulation human intelligence machines programmed think like humans mimic actions’. This translates to, work a human fast speed 100% accuracy.
 In definition would define A.I. god form human beings.
 Now question arises is, A.I. entails future?
 A.I. fancy enough continue existing minds time, come certain limitations threats a cause a peaceful sleep workers. With introduction different areas workplace, clear half human jobs would taken A.I. would arise a need jobs humans upcoming AI-based ventures different industries. Thereby giving us fair share back us.
 In a survey, found believed AI devastating humans professionals tech-savvy people believed inculcating AI technology business daily lives would a remarkable step lead flourishment business future give a competitive edge rivals.
 People believed advanced technologies would come together work humans, produce a smarter strategic decision productive collaborative practices. More modern technology prevailing organization lead stress reduction produce satisfying results thereby making organization efficient.
 The Organizations use AI technology responds saying managers comfortable using A.I. accustomed organizations looking forward integration higher-end technology systems, believed technology result productivity thereby making profits long run.
 Many jobs today require AI humans working collaboration, creates a positive signal future humans would working closely technology. Beyond training developing machines, humans would working close vicinity making decisions act result given machine.
 It said AI advanced technology human can’t remain workforce without other, technology produce accurate top-notch results requires someone make delivery.
 e.g., a firm, AI-based system produces results based historical data a need someone analyze communicate present data respective stakeholders whether inside outside organization.
 Various uses artificial intelligence technology day-to-day functions regards interactions humans are:
 Chatbots
 Email curation
 A.I. powered advertising
 Automated image recognition
 Self-sufficient driving
 Voice activation much more.
 Here figure A represents ‘Artificial Intelligence’ B represents ‘Humans’
 Artificial intelligence know works algorithms, neural networks, deep learning analytical tools help AI taking analytical decisions based data provided.
 Whereas, humans hand take higher-level decisions based ‘Intuition’ sometimes, refers gut feeling generates humans concerning situation challenge.
 AI alone can’t work handle critical situations needs humans reciprocate share information stakeholders, humans alone can’t anticipate much accurate fast-paced analytical solutions problems persisting place situation.
 The strength humans AI working synergy surprisingly beneficial advantageous organizations.
 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE JOBS
 It believed machines future would eating traditional jobs. But reality seems turning otherwise.
 The future trend shows future AI-powered technology would take jobs done humans return would produce jobs would require human interference them. As newer technology approaching countries proceeding towards GIG Economies, future, witness increase freelance jobs permanent labor market norms could reduce drastically.
 Some jobs today replaced AI transportation retail commerce sector 100% automated future years. There ‘Amazon Go’ store uses technology goes name ‘Just walk technology’ wherein need human-induced workforce operations carried AI-powered technologies, indeed a breakthrough technology today’s world.
 Rather eating jobs AI return creating jobs future creating massive innovations thereby fueling industries thereby giving us fair share jobs back.
 There a lot demand placed upcoming young workforce also categorized ‘Gen Z’. They expected know technology would high demand.  These young generations required learn skills needed survive dynamic changing environment, activities carried workers automated, demand people working back office maintaining developing technology versions.  
 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CONSTRAINTS
 AI powered technology limitations makes a rigid system hold also makes a costly affair initial stage.  
 It predicted cost electricity power a supercharged AI model around $4.6 million. So, super-powered AI purchased big fortune firms thereby creating value net worth.
 One major limitations AI contain biased data scientists put data create biasedness resultant output would a biased report.
 These machines neuroscience-based technology yet enables carry human emotions understand complex situations a creative that, tend a lack box thinking case rigid programmed work a single task cannot perform a single task time.
 It also believed exists creativity computer, matter fast-paced, intelligent.
  PREPARING FUTURE
 Business organization
 Businesses organizations need understand anticipate opportunities future holds need start training employees based today’s dynamic changing technology. While it’s unclear future holds us, anticipation could benefit us several ways.
 As unclear future looks like, need think probable terms could turn employ specific training programs employees organization.
 The training employees needed done a continuous lifetime basis means education won’t limited PG degrees a lifetime process learning.
 As Covid-19 changed scenario work patterns around world, need think strategically working dynamics future look like compared pre-covid post-covid scenario.
 Employees playing a major role transforming organizations work practices upcoming future, organizations need select recruit candidates pool provide practices machines make proficient area work. Policies need developed hire people retaining talent organization.
 There needs a continuous scanning environment organizations comprehend trends assess them, trends beneficial organizations, must aware prospects plan future systematically consistently.
 CONCLUSION
 There lies a possibility future certain years now, could machines general human intelligence would able answer deep meaningful questions asking ‘Why curtains blue?’, would able clean cars, play politics tell jokes us, using deep machine learning programs level intelligence would beyond mathematical calculations us. That’s good machines future, make competitive machines, would need train impending ambiguous future ahead us.
 Humans machines need work synergy get beneficial satisfying results parties.
 Machines indeed going take away jobs, let make sleep peacefully tonight, machines aren’t arriving we’re retired.
