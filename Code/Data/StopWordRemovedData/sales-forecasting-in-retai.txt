 Introduction
 Inventory planning a fundamental part retail operations. Proper retail inventory management, helps balance supply demand, relies heavily accurate forecast future demand. In fact, sales forecasting refers predicting future demand (or sales), assuming factors affected demand past affecting present influence future. It important task difficult accomplish.
 In retailing industry, defined retailing business products including apparel, shoes, fashion beauty products, forecasting treated like a “service” represents set analytical tools facilitate companies make decisions predicting future. Undoubtedly, a good forecasting service system help avoid understocking over-stocking retail inventory planning, relates critical operations whole supply chain due date management, production planning, pricing, achieving high customer service level. In order achieve economics sustainability a highly competitive environment, a company adopt a consumer-demand driven “pull” operational strategy means forecasting becomes a critically important task.
 Compared retailing service industries, well argued sales forecasting a difficult task fashion retailing fashion product’s demand highly volatile ever-changing taste consumers fashion product’s life cycle short. In addition, sales fashion products strongly affected “stochastically” seasonal factors, fashion trend factors, tricky variables (e.g., weather, marketing strategy, political climate, item features, macroeconomic trend). These, together fact fashion retailers carrying a large number stock-keeping units (SKUs) limited historical sales data, make sales forecasting challenging call sophisticated versatile analytical tools. On hand, known fashion apparel supply chain a relatively long includes upstream cotton plants, fiber manufacturers, apparel factories, distributors, wholesalers, retailers. As a consequence, notorious bullwhip effect a particularly strong influence fashion supply chain. Since forecasting a critical factor relating presence significance bullwhip effect, improving forecasting help reduce bullwhip effect directly enhances efficiency fashion supply chain.
 Statistical Fashion Sales Forecasting Methods
 Traditionally, fashion sales forecasting accomplished statistical methods. In fact, a lot statistical methods used sales forecasting, includes linear regression, moving average, weighted average, exponential smoothing (used a trend present linear), exponential smoothing trend, double exponential smoothing, Bayesian analysis, forth.
 Statistical time series analysis tools ARIMA SARIMA widely employed sales forecasting. Since methods a closed form expression forecasting, simple easy implement results computed quickly.
 AI Fashion Retail Sales Forecasting Methods
 The pure statistical models a deficiency conducting fashion retail forecasting, order improve forecasting accuracy. AI methods emerge advance computer technology. In fact, AI models efficiently derive “arbitrarily nonlinear” approximation functions directly data. Popular methods artificial neural network (ANN) models fuzzy logic models commonly employed literature kind models employed fashion retail sales forecasting. To specific, ANN models developed provide satisfactory results different domains.
 Hybrid Methods Fashion Sales Forecasting
 Hybrid forecasting methods usually developed based fact utilize strengths different models together form a forecasting method. As such, considered efficient pure statistical models pure AI models. It surprising recent years, a number research works examine hybrid forecasting methods. Hybrid methods employed fashion forecasting literature often combine different schemes fuzzy model, ANN, ELM techniques statistical models, grey model (GM), forth. Following adapted hybrid methods:
 Fuzzy Logic Based Hybrid Methods
 Neural Network Based Hybrid Methods
 ELM Based Hybrid Methods
 Applications Fashion Industry
 Sales forecasting a real-world problem fashion retailing. From perspective applications implementation, various issues identified.
 In terms forecasting horizon, existing forecasting models suitable middle-term long-term forecasting. However, short-term forecasting, including short term forecasting real-time forecasting, yet fully explored. This kind short-term forecasting important given nature fashion industry (the fashion trend unpredictable, lead time short).
 Regarding product type forecasted, kinds products involved, namely, existing product a product. Compared existing products forecasting, prediction product forecasting seems much complicated difficult, due absence historical sales data.
 In terms speed, general, statistical methods output forecasting results quickly. AI methods usually time-consuming. In past, lead time fashion industry a bit longer now, lead time ten months even year. However, fashion industry changed fast fashion companies like ZARA, H&M, Mango adopting quick response strategy a short lead time (e.g., 2 weeks Zara products). As a result, forecasting result must available within a short time forecasting application companies.
