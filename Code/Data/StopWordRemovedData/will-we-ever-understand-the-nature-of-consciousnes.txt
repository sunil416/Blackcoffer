 Introduction
 The definition consciousness controversial centuries, hence given title ‘most familiar yet mysterious aspects lives’. An idea concept would awareness beings surroundings, themselves, perception. The reason part mind remains unascertained consciousness isn’t observable, unlike brain matter studied scientifically. physical clarification awareness a general sense incomplete: doesn’t include feels subject, subject. There likewise accounts unbridgeable illustrative gap physical world consciousness. As suggested incident Eastern Shamir traditions, consciousness universal primal. Whilst made tremendous progress understanding brain activity years, research hasn’t able answer questions relating nature emotions experiences.
 History
 Beginning within late nineteenth century, a time psychological queries driven a philosophical understanding mind, typically equated consciousness. As a result, analysis brain behavior naturally thought role consciousness behavioral management brain.
 The Ancient Mayans propose a sorted feeling degree consciousness, purpose, worldly association mankind. Since consciousness incorporates stimuli nature well interior stimuli, Mayans trusted essential type existence, equipped evolution. The Incas, however, thought consciousness a movement mindfulness well worry others too.
 John Locke, early philosopher, said consciousness, individuality, freelanced substances. He also detected reason believe consciousness stuck specific body mind, consciousness cannot transferred body mind a different one. Karl Marx, another early thinker, denies mind-body classification holds consciousness jeopardized material eventualities one’s settings. William James, American psychologist, differentiated consciousness a stream – unbroken continuous despite several changes shifts.
 While main center a lot analysis moved strictly note cable behaviors throughout primary half twentieth century, analysis human consciousness grown staggeringly 1950s.
 In Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytic theory, believed levels awareness- preconscious, conscious, unconscious responsible one’s behavior thinking. He believed mid divided parts- id, ego, superego. The Id present birth, instinctual, operates according pleasure principle. The ego underseals reality logic develops id infancy. Finally, superego internalization society’s moral standards responsible guilt. Now, Id regarded unconscious, whereas ego superego also conscious preconscious. Freud constantly revised clinical qualities researches, however, didn’t conduct scientific experiments hence work heavily scrutinized, leaving questions unanswered.  
 Sigmund Freud’s theory differed psychologists since theories understandable easily conveyed people. Sigmund Freud’s work hypotheses helped people shape perspectives youth, character, memory, sexuality, therapy. However, theories subject considerable criticism life. Whilst John Locke William James took a practical approach mystery conducting experiments, Sigmund Freud didn’t provide evidence support claims.
 Brain
 Today, essential focal point consciousness research understanding consciousness implies biologically mentally. Issues interest include phenomena perception, blindsight, brainwaves sleep, altered states consciousness produced psychoactive drugs.
 A greater part test assesses consciousness approaching human subjects a verbal report encounters. However, confirm criticalness verbal reports, researchers must contrast action happens brain —that is, search neural connections consciousness.
 Hope locate noticeable action a specific aspect brain, a particular pattern global brain activity, greatly predictive consciousness mindfulness. A brain imaging strategies, example, EEG MRI scans, utilized physical proportions brain activities examinations.
 A investigations shown movement essential primary sensory areas brain isn’t adequate create consciousness: workable subjects report absence awareness event, areas, example, primary visual cortex show clear electrical reactions a stimulus. Higher brain areas viewed encouraging, particularly prefrontal cortex, involved a range high order functions.
 One mainstream theory implicates various examples brain waves creating various conditions consciousness. Analysts record mind waves, drawings electrical movement inside cerebrum, using electroencephalograph (EEG) placing electrodes scalp. The types brain waves (alpha, beta, theta, delta) correspond mental state (relaxed, alert, lightly asleep, deeply asleep)
 Memory
 Episodic memory regarded form conscious memory. This capacity consciously remember personally experienced events situations past. The hippocampus located brain’s temporal lobe responsible type memory.
 Consciousness also plays a part important memory distinctions. One distinction implicit explicit characteristics; explicit memory consciously know implicit memory includes events conscious of.
 Furthermore, several empirical findings suggest declarative memory related consciousness well; meaning retrieval formation memory connected awareness. Working memory operates/maintains consciously perceived information well since temporarily stores tampers information whilst working tasks.
 The current ways testing information lacking several essential aspects, including spatial resolution, temporal resolution, scope. Examples methods PET, fMRI, EEG, implanted electrodes, etc.
 PET fMRI temporal resolution problems, EEG well-known localizability difficulties, implanted electrodes whilst great temporal spatial resolution test a set number neurons; is, restricted scope. Hence, huge numbers speculations, testable a fundamental level, appear difficult test now.
 Mental illness
 Consciousness influence objects around us, encourages us settle choices communicate them. Experiencing difficulty perceiving objects connected a problems, example, agnosia (a failure decipher visual data), Alzheimer’s disease, autism. However, actually don’t comprehend visual data basic mind intentionally perceive object.
 Several different disorders consciousness include locked-in syndrome, minimally conscious state, persistent vegetative state, chronic coma, brain death.
 Locked-in syndrome, otherwise called pseudo coma, a condition wherein a patient aware however can’t move impart verbally complete loss motion essentially voluntary muscles body aside vertical eye developments squinting. The individual conscious able speak eye movements.
 In a minimally conscious state, patient intermittent periods awareness wakefulness. Patients need give restricted, however reproducible indications consciousness themself current circumstance. This could following straightforward orders, comprehensible speech, purposeful conduct.
 In a persistent vegetative state, patient sleep-wake cycles, lacks awareness, able communicate, displays reflexive non-purposeful behavior. The term refers organic body able grow develop devoid intellectual activity social intercourse
 Like coma, chronic coma results generally cortical white-matter harm neuronal axonal injury, central brainstem sores. Usually, metabolism grey matter decreases 50-70% normal range. The patient lies eyes shut doesn’t know environmental factors.
 Brain death irreversible end brain activity, function (including involuntary activity necessary sustain life). The main cause total necrosis cerebral neurons following loss brain oxygenation. After brain death patient lacks sense awareness; sleep-wake cycles behavior, typically look dead a deep sleep state.
 Future predictions conclusion
 As history scholar’s endeavors study consciousness empirically, nature defined using scientific methods. In past, psychologists Descartes came dualistic theories line fundamental laws physics. In battle realists illusionists, taking sides fundamentally impossible topic doesn’t allow concrete evidence.
 As observe neural examinations brain detect causes consciousness, sensory sector brain cause aware a certain event even clear signs a reaction a stimulus. Similarly, even though consciousness plays a major role memory, currently lack facilities research fully. In future, a possibility able access facilities, however, could allow us find neural connections ties mental illness well. Not would help several people making us aware causes perspective certain things, would also give us a better chance recognizing signs possible mental illness issues beforehand.
 As seems, researchers continue study unknown part mind able fund recover global pandemic, able answer psychology’s difficult questions.
