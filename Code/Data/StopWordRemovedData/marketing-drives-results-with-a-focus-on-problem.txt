 Marketing design develop a pathway product service customer a product, price, place promotion strategies. Marketing depends a variety parameters classified broadly, boiling vital three. These ‘What type customer marketing team focusing (based gender, age, location, customer-class) (W1)’, ‘What Product Specification Applications need bring front customer (W2)’, ‘What Product Promotion flow path (W3)’, ‘How much time takes convey product information customer (H1)’. These criteria call ‘3W1H’ forms. These basics need taken care developing a marketing strategy upcoming product. However, enough? No. There parameter called Feedback mechanism (FM). Generally, machines use feedback mechanism check output generated per input given not, input corrected get required output. When comes human beings, he/she surrounded multiple products daily social media, TV advertising forth. Slight uncertainties either side observation make a positive negative impact product consumer’s mind. In feedback mechanism, marketing team needs answer question “What kind product image built customer mind promotional activities?” If product image built per expectation, management review work 3W1H, discussed earlier. So let’s elaborate 3W1H approach works along feedback mechanism.
 Fig.1- 3W1H FM process target customer effectively
 After deciding customer range, work activities. Since customer conscious purchasing product product promoted, thing customer check usefulness, his/her answer ‘Yes,’ customer start comparing similar alternative products market. Therefore, present product along unique thought express product a image imprinted consumer mind. For example, polio campaign India. The government taken initiative make India polio-free spreading awareness types social communication mediums, Television played a vital role. Legendary cinema actor ‘Amitabh Bachchan’ selected ambassador campaign. Initially, advertisement published Amitabh pleaded people vaccinating children within a fixed schedule. The advertisement circulated throughout nation, stone kept unturned government make campaign successful. However, much surprise, advertising failed miserably attract a deprived community polio booth. This promotion failure non-consideration customer (W1) advertise impacted application customer (W2)? So analysing failure, experts recommended changes marketing campaign like, focus major customer (Here mainly village woman generally spend time home watching TV), type impact people (People watched TV era, image Amitabh ‘Angry young man’). So campaign improved advertising bringing angry Amitabh instead soft-image, used earlier campaign. So a next polio campaign number people polio booth suddenly increased feedback taken people a sudden change, replied don’t want watch ‘Amitabh sir’ getting angry us.[i]
 In W3, organisation must focus kind channel use attract customer. Currently, a lot platforms available market product. The main agenda keep mind effectively engage customer marketing, first, make impact customer only, show interest product. For example, changes launching trailers upcoming films. Till 20th century Television newspaper crucial factors, along television, marketing team take help internet resources like Youtube, Facebook, introducing article pre-trailer phenomenon. Increasing range promotional devices, broadcast formats publishing platforms provide a broad range promote film choosing right platform lead a massive hit box-office.    
 For last factor (H1) time, obvious question comes mind ‘Is time advertising matters?’, While watching TV advertisement appears, times change channel instead watching whole ad ignore altogether. You option ‘Skip ad’ watch anything online, must decide much time required deliver product information promotion? Delivering product information less time, create possibility customer watch result attracting customers. So, content king marketing. However, must guessed it, work time. Other factors like cost product, application range, type customer also affect H1. For example, customer would conscious watching higher-priced product broadcast compare lower-priced one. So would take time marketing team convince customer buy expensive good lower-priced one.
 After implementing a marketing strategy per 3W1H, need work a feedback mechanism organization collect information product image generated customer’s minds dealers using feedback-form. Not using feedback mechanism lead failure achieving ‘product sales target’ make situation even worse. Take example ‘THE TATA Nano-MAKING WORLD’S CHEAPEST CAR,’ mind-blowing one-of-a-kind projects Indian automobile industry. From phase a marketing campaign, TATA Nano much continuous limelight project pleased former American president Barack Obama.[ii] The curiosity product high sale then-leading car model Maruti-800 dropped 20% immediately unveiling Nano.[iii] However, marketing product, organization built “Affordable, Garibo Ki Car” image customer’s mind, made customers conscious status-quo society buying Nano? Thus, started giving preference two-wheelers Nano. During time, instances Nanos catching fire came focus, worsened situation. This case even exacerbates team work feedback mechanism hence, able change customer perception Nano. Later, Nano fire problem technically sorted even then, marketing team make impactful effort market improved safety car. Therefore, customer’s negative perception remained stuck organization even come close achieving selling figures Nano. If organization used feedback mechanism, would entirely different story.
 So 3W1H essential factor developing a marketing strategy product along a reversible FM method. This method help us monitor Product marketing throughout phases help marketing team change strategy whenever goes wrong path.
