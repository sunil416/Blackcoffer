 As coronavirus spreads around world countries implement containment measures, energy supply demand disrupted. The impact country-wide lockdowns demand slowdowns energy markets evolving every day.
 Impact energy markets are:
 i)Slump wind expansion support German power prices:
 The recent slump German wind capacity likely continue year complicated regulations weakness global economic outlook due coronavirus likely dampen investment renewable technology.
 This potential restrict future additions wind output, impacting supply and, turn, supporting power prices.
 ii)Chinese industrial gas demand remains weak March:
 Chinese natural gas demand industrial sector March almost 25% year year, according Chongqing Gas Petroleum Exchange released Easter, impact coronavirus continued weigh consumption.
 iii)Reduced energy offtake likely hit UK suppliers:
 A growing number British energy suppliers could risk colllapsing reduced energy offtake cash-flow constraints amid coronavirus pandemic, according industry sources polled ICIS.
 iv)Breakdown European power demand impact :
 Power consumption continued soften across key European demand centres March week April, less stringent measures colder weather sheltered parts Europe.
 v)Brexit set ensure EU 2020 renewable goals:
 While coronavirus outbreak already a significant impact European renewables sector, unintended consequence pandemic likely achievement EU member state binding renewable energy targets 2020. This due consequences a prolonged downturn demand, normalised EU’s official statistics office (Eurostat), meaning renewables look set make a higher share consumption 2020 across EU.
 vi)Spanish prices stay bearish premium France persist:
 Spanish power prices across curve expected maintain a bearish trajectory throughout nationwide coronavirus lockdown period recently extended 26 April, extensions possible.
 Nevertheless, forecasts below-average wind generation would support Spanish spot prices, allowing France continue exporting power Spain. This turn keep Spanish near-curve contracts a premium French equivalents.
 vii)Coronavirus hits truck-loaded LNG demand:
 Market sources indicated coronavirus reduced demand truck-loaded LNG around Europe, countries implemented lockdown measures low oil prices made gas less competitive a transport fuel.
 Data terminals northwest Europe shows impact significant originally thought.
 viii)Europe found a coronavirus electricity demand floor:
 Electricity consumption leveled Germany, France Italy, falling several weeks due restrictions aimed stemming spread coronavirus.
 But Great Britain Spain, demand continued drop week week recent days, according ICIS model controls impact temperature across Europe’s largest consumers electricity.
 ix)European power carbon markets affected COVID-19 – early impact assessment:
 In order assess fundamental impact COVID-19 European power carbon markets modelled a scenario accounted data dropping electricity demand well assumed industry production cuts continued travel restrictions.
 x)India defers LNG cargoes lockdown ramps up:
 India buyers deferring LNG cargoes ports close operations strict lockdowns place. This a concern sellers a long market India key buyers.
 xi)EU reach 2020 renewables goals coronavirus, Brexit:
 The combination Brexit lower demand associated coronavirus pandemic enable EU a whole well member states reach 2020 renewable targets, according ICIS model run.
 xii)European power markets yet hit coronavirus demand floor:
 European power demand continue drop governments escalate measures stem spread coronavirus.
 Electricity consumption Italy France fell 16% expectations past days, according ICIS model controls impact temperatures.
 Three major power markets studied ICIS – Germany, Spain UK – seen smaller drops, although trending down.
 xiii)Virus demand hit wipe 9% 2020 European power prices:
 • Power demand drop likely
 • ICIS model indicates 6% drop demand 2020
 • Price fall 9% across Europe
 A scenario power demand drops one-tenth June a result measures taken slow spread coronavirus would power prices across European markets fall average 9% 2020.
 xiv)Weather-driven NBP prompt upside possible week 13:
 • Temperatures across NW Europe tumble week 14
 • British local distribution zone demand increase
 • EAX-NBP premium gaining
 Incoming cooler weather across Britain week 14 could encourage buying across NBP prompt near curve contracts coming sessions. The drop temperatures likely trigger a spike heating demand also increased due large numbers people working home curb spread coronavirus.
 xv)Southeast Europe braced falling demand, bankruptcies:
 Eastern European Turkish energy companies braced sharp drops demand potential bankruptcies countries introduce emergency measures a bid contain coronavirus outbreak.
 Although spread virus extensive region Italy Spain, impact emergency measures taken likely felt acutely national economies fragile.
 xvi)Europe course sharp reduction power demand:
 Power sector demand across key European countries set a major slump coming weeks countries scale-up efforts tackle spread coronavirus.
 Demand Italy, hit hardest outbreak, dropped 10% compared five-year average March week nationwide lockdown.
 As measures tackle spread virus intensifies across European countries, a similar drop demand expected, although changes unlikely uniform.
 xvii)China’s city gas demand steady despite coronavirus, uncertain elsewhere:
 The impact coronavirus China reduced gas demand end March well 2019. City-gate gas demand firm outlook sectors remains a concern.
 xix)European gas centres set April demand destruction:
 • EU-wide demand crunch could follow lockdowns intensify
 • Residential demand brief increase falling warmer temperatures
 • LNG sellers could struggle deliver Europe
 xx)Coronavirus effects ripple Mexico:
 Mexico’s economy perhaps never exposed global supply chains commodity markets hit shocks coronavirus oil price war, president losing time engaging denial political pandering. These help party’s 2021 election prospects country’s economic performance falls currency takes a beating amid capital flight.
 xxi)China’s gas demand rebounds – satellite data:
 Emissions nitrogen dioxide rise China. This indication economic activity rising businesses industry ramp activity coronavirus impact subsiding.
 xxii)Spanish virus impact LNG imports:
 Spain home Europe’s LNG import capacity, a lockdown potential gum global LNG supply chain if, seems likely, leads a drop demand gas a reduced ability support scheduled imports.
 xxiii)European nuclear plant operators gear ensure power supply:
 European nuclear power availability expected remain robust strict safety measures already implemented major plant operators amid coronavirus outbreak.
 xxiv)Bulgarian power traders call nuclear maintenance change:
 Bulgaria’s free energy market association ASEP called measures tackle national power market disruption due coronavirus outbreak 16 March.
 xxv)Global market moves feed energy downside jitters:
 Heightened concerns surrounding economic fall-out coronavirus set weigh European energy markets, traders say.
 xxvi)Coronavirus likely lower trader appetite risk:
 Widespread remote working due coronavirus set hit European natural gas power liquidity, according traders.
 A number firms already asked traders work home expected so.
 While trading activities around gas power dispatching need done a trading floor, tasks done home.
 However, traders indicated unlikely business normal participants increasingly risk averse away office environment.
 xxvii)Italian gas demand plunges coronavirus restrictions:
 The coronavirus outbreak took a toll Italian gas demand week 11 government extended nationwide restrictions against spread virus.
 If restrictions continue, demand gas prices likely fall warmer temperatures follow spring, pressuring consumption heating. Power prices also expected plunge back weaker gas. Gas Italy’s main source power generation marginal fuel, therefore a price maker Italian power.
 xxviii)Expect weakness Chinese summer gas demand:
 • Coronavirus impact LPG worsen
 • China’s big sought LNG volume deferrals another means deal mounting oversupply
 • Incremental demand gas LNG summer unusually low
 xxix)Coronavirus fails pull Italian power demand significantly:
 The Italian wholesale electricity market far avoided major losses following outbreak Coronavirus country, strongest far across Europe.
