 Every prophet doom, unless also happens a psychopath, hopes predictions borne out. This also true epidemiologists virologists warning world since January novel SARS-CoV-2 virus poses a severe threat public health around world. The name Coronavirus itself, vicious enough terrify otherwise fearless face ball game. Tracing back origins pandemic, find coronavirus emerged Wuhan, a city 11 million people China’s Hubei province, late 2019. Cases disease grew several thousand per day China late January early February, peak epidemic there. The number infections appearing day since plummeted China, making outbreak a global pandemic engulfed 214 countries around globe.
 Besides a health crisis, virus already brought a major downfall world economy IMF estimating coronavirus-induced global downturn ‘way worse’ financial crisis. As coronavirus spreads across globe, appears setting a devastating feedback loop another gravest forces time: economic inequality. Research suggests lower economic strata likelier catch disease owing inability meet rising drug prices. According International Labour Organization(ILO), COVID-19 far-reaching impacts labor market outcomes. Beyond urgent concerns health workers families, virus subsequent economic shocks impact world work across key dimensions.
 Initial ILO estimates point a significant rise unemployment underemployment wake virus. Based different scenarios impact COVID-19 global GDP growth, preliminary ILO estimates indicate a rise global unemployment 5.3 million (“low” scenario) 24.7 million (“high” scenario) a base level 188 million 2019. The “mid” scenario suggests increase 13 million (7.4 million high-income countries). Though estimates remain highly uncertain, figures indicate a substantial rise global unemployment. For comparison, global financial crisis 2008-9 increased unemployment 22 million. While self-employment typically react economic downturns, acts a “default” option survival maintaining income – often informal economy. For reason, informal employment tends increase crises. However, current limitations movement people goods restrict type coping mechanism.
 Labour supply declining quarantine measures a fall economic activity. At point, a preliminary estimate suggests infected workers already lost nearly 30,000 work months, consequent loss income (for unprotected workers). Employment impacts imply large income losses workers. Overall losses labour income expected range 860 3,440 billion USD. The loss labour income translate lower consumption goods services, detrimental continuity businesses ensuring economies resilient. Working poverty also likely increase significantly. The strain incomes resulting decline economic activity devastate workers close poverty line. The growth impacts virus used unemployment estimates suggest additional 8.8 million people working poverty around world originally estimated (i.e. overall decline 5.2 million working poor 2020 compared a decline 14 million estimated pre-COVID-19). Under mid high scenarios, 20.1 million 35.0 million people working poverty pre-COVID-19 estimate 2020.
 Who particularly vulnerable?Epidemics economic crises a disproportionate impact certain segments population, trigger worsening inequality. Based past experience current information COVID-19 pandemic insights previous crises, a number groups identified:
 Those underlying health conditions older people risk developing serious health issues.
 Young persons, already facing higher rates unemployment underemployment, vulnerable falling labor demand, witnessed global financial crisis. 
 Women over-represented affected sectors (such services) occupations front line dealing pandemic (e.g. nurses). The ILO estimates 58.6 percent employed women work services sector around world, compared 45.4 percent men.
 Unprotected workers, including self-employed, casual, gig workers, likely disproportionately hit virus access paid sick leave mechanisms, less protected conventional social protection mechanisms forms income smoothing.
 Migrant workers particularly vulnerable impact COVID-19 crisis, constrain ability access places work destination countries return families.
 The extent severity coronavirus pandemic impact fight end extreme poverty unknown, expected crisis devastate world’s vulnerable people including world work. The virus already disproportionately impacting poor wealthy countries, known cases concentrated. Experts urging world prepare lend extra support low-income countries address pandemic. COVID-19 cases likely go undetected under-detected developing countries fewer resources available tackle a pandemic. Countries large poor populations including Brazil, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan confirmed cases, slow respond threat, according NPR. Preventative care health education less accessible low-income people likely pre-existing conditions, catch COVID-19, die it. People living poverty also likely hold insecure jobs cannot afford stay home sick work.
 In times crisis, International Labour Standards provide a strong foundation key policy responses focus crucial role decent work achieving a sustained equitable recovery mitigate impacts COVID-19 world work. These standards, adopted representatives governments, workers’ employers’ organizations, provide a human-centered approach growth development, including triggering policy levers stimulate demand protect workers enterprises.
 Policy responses focus immediate goals: Health protection measures economic support demand- supply-side associated cause.
 First, workers employers families protected health risks COVID-19. Protective measures workplace across communities introduced strengthened, requiring large-scale public support investment.
 Second, timely, large-scale, coordinated policy efforts taken provide employment income support stimulate economy labor demand. These measures cushion enterprises workers against immediate employment income losses, also help prevent a chain supply shocks (e.g. losses workers’ productivity capacities) demand shocks (e.g. suppressing consumption workers families) could lead a prolonged economic recession.
 In challenging times, countries come forward protect workers workplace decisive measures combat spread disease, ameliorating pernicious effect economy labor market across policy pillars: protecting workers workplace, stimulating economy labor demand, supporting employment income. Some policies include Working arrangements, including telework; Occupational Safety Health (OSH) advice; Expanded access paid sick leave; Prevention discrimination exclusion. While measures doubt help contain pandemic, respond emergency needs generated pave a gradual recovery, clear needs done. Past crises experiences countries, reacted late context current COVID-19 crisis, show preparedness early action critical.
 The coronavirus pandemic a test. It’s a test medical capacity political will. It’s a test endurance forbearance, believers a test religious faith. It’s a test, too, a different kind faith, strength ideas humans choose help form moral judgments guide personal social behavior. The epidemic forces everyone confront deep questions human existence, questions profound previously answered, different ways, greatest philosophers. It’s a test humans stand. What right wrong? What individuals expect society, society expect them? Should others make sacrifices me, vice versa? Is set economic limits fighting a deadly disease? How long stay way? And epidemic grows worse brings disease within fewer degrees separation everyone, well find notion loving thy neighbor thyself becomes far potent.
  At last would like conclude saying COVID-19 something face a community, thus something solve a community, weapons, goodwill common efforts.
