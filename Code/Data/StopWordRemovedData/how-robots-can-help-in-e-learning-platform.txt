 If asked thing pandemic taught us? believe word be: Adaptability, ability change, upgrade adapt changing circumstances without losing individuality. The crisis caused Covid-19 tested perseverance, strength, adaptability possible way. In words, survival fittest begun!
 The COVID-19 resulted shutdown schools colleges worldwide, 1.2 billion students away physical classroom. As a result, education dramatically changed rise e-learning.
 Most The Educational Institutions, Universities, Schools, Colleges across world, specifically India, followed Traditional setup face-to-face learning classroom outbreak deadly coronavirus. Even though last ten years, various e-learning platforms emerged, like Byjus, Unacademy, Vedantu, Upgrade, international e-learning platforms like edx, udemy, Coursera pandemic lockdown worked a catalyst amplified speed process, boosted demand e-learning platform manifold times. The Platforms like BYJU’S, world’s highly valued ed-tech company seen a 200% increase number students using product, according company’s Chief Operating Officer, Mrinal Mohit. The school, colleges, universities reluctant change traditional pedagogical approaches shift online mode teaching learning overnight. The teachers, students, government dependent online mode education, even come pandemic e-learning, online mode education future!

 So make experience online teaching learning better, robots AI help it?
 There doubt e-learning flexible, time-saving, revolutionize education system, subsequent challenges well, work upon make user experience better effective. While talking challenges, main problems are:
 Connectivity: The crucial problem students teachers faced internet connectivity issues. Internet vital part e-learning. A stable good internet connection compulsory teach learn online mode, poor unstable network connectivity major obstacle, specifically India, learning teaching online.
 Gadgets Technology: Effective online education possible without right equipment gadgets. The technical glitch face interrupt process learning. Therefore, need sustainable, efficient, affordable tools support e-learning. 
 Cost: The main problem e-learning cost maintenance charges brings it, unaffordable many. 
 Personal Interaction: According survey conducted writing article, main hurdle online education Personal Interaction connection a teacher a student. Face-to-face teaching learning help build ecosystem environment learning subjects, network relationship build teachers classmates, makes us part community around life revolves a student, develop individual. 
 Authenticity: As know, examination a crucial part learning, taking exams online mode great difficulty. It impossible monitor students a single teacher a virtual screen. Therefore, students easily take help unethical means give exams online mode. Hence relevance taking exams get lost don’t find a solution problem.
 Digital Literacy: Many people, particularly ones older generations others, neither habituated exposed technology early age. Therefore, cannot teach learn online mode efficiently. Last year due lockdown, senior school teachers faced a lot difficulties teaching online. The sudden countrywide lockdown made shift online without prior experience. Hence created a lot challenges them.
 Adaptability: E-learning popular adults teenagers amongst young kids. They well trained learn online. They get easily distracted face difficulties learning understanding concepts a virtual screen. They need undivided attention engaging environment learn, available e-learning platform.
 Health: Constantly looking virtual screen puts a strain eyes causes eye discomfort vision problems. This problem severe amongst young kids. Children spend a prolonged period front computer screen e-learning platforms might affect eyes long run.
 Inclusion: E-learning inclusive ways. Most e-learning platforms don’t take consideration specially-abled individuals. And want use e-learning platforms, isn’t user-friendly them.
 Copyright Issues: There a copyright issue e-learning portals. Someone try record classes use benefit. A student hasn’t register a particular course sit beside a friend enrolled gain knowledge without paying it. In way, several misuses e-learning platforms.
 conducted a survey collected information teachers students age groups active users e-learning platforms. The ten points mentioned relevant issues facing e-learning platform.
 So question is, make experience better using AI robots?
 At first, would start copyright issue. We take help AI robots build systems detect presence a camera room student present. This process prevent duplication. Secondly, use a robot detect individual staring screen taking class notes.
 Therefore, adopting kind method prevent copyright issues face.
 Next comes point inclusion. As already stated, e-learning platforms consider specially-abled individuals. So solve problem, take help robot translate teachings code languages understand. Robots also give dictations assist writing. In way, create a inclusive ecosystem.
 A robot effective tool overcome language barrier. We convert teachings different languages help a robot. Then reach a larger audience, people learn mother tongue. This a revolutionizing step promote diversity.
 Another key aspect discussed health! By taking help robots, AI minimize effects visual discomfort reduce strain eyes. This go a long protect kids adults computer vision syndrome.

 While talking kids, would bring point adaptability which, mentioned earlier. Kids need attention interacting environment learn enjoy learning process. Therefore, e-learning portals take help robots make learning process engaging. They develop a technology kids feel teachers interacting one-to-one basics them, even classroom thirty forty students. This process might help grab more, keeping interest subject intact growing. Since children well trained use complicated technology, make simple, handy, adaptable.
 But want make e-learning portals future education system, keep things mind. Learning academics. Building discipline, peer-to-peer relationships, teamwork, developing a strong sense ethics, integrity, communication skills, leadership skills a part learning process. Hence, e-learning portals use robots AI implant learning process make wholesome.
