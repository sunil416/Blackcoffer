 Even though COVID-19 yet halted facing nth wave coronavirus outbreak across several countries, notably US, India, Brazil. It a fact Data Analytics AI big guns artillery fight against COVID-19 pandemic. It helped us several stages outbreak, like detection outbreak, vaccine development manufacturing contact tracing, future hotspot detection. Some interesting applications discussed article.
 A lesser-known fact COVID-19 outbreak detected Toronto, Canada, nearly 7,230 miles away outbreak, days issued warning. It help Big Data Analytics AI, specifically Deep Learnings (DL, a subset Machine Learning) application Natural Language Processing (NLP) analyze text inputs traced surge pneumonia cases Wuhan province China. The specialty DL algorithms mimic brain cells called neurons identify patterns Big Data. This DL-backed software used inputs, reports public health organizations, global airline ticketing data, etc. These used flag unusual surges potential spreads infectious diseases.
 The next application Big Data Analytics AI Research Development drugs halt COVID-19. AI used analyze protein structure virus, findings significant progress vaccine development. In preliminary studies, found mutate fast viruses HIV, means a prophylactic vaccine a better proceed rather a therapy. But also evidence supporting fact find kind cure it, a chance virus mutating, happened major mutations found UK, Brazil, South Africa. AI also assisted scientists rapidly shortlisting a set already available vaccines could effective against coronavirus.
 Another interesting application AI found selection right candidates, i.e. likely test positive testing coronavirus case insufficient testing resources. This method exercised Greek borders called project EVA. Whenever a traveler wanted come Greece, fill a form known Passenger Locator Form (PLF) least 24 hours prior arrival, containing information origin country, demographics, point, date entry, intended destination. EVA allocated testing resources according size set passengers tested. After test results, found positive, put quarantine. The results sent back program real-time learning.
 The question remains EVA made allocations, It found that, statistically, origin country city significant factors screening. Ultimately, a variety countries city pairs, EVA predict testing resources allocated entry point particular passengers a location technically called Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem, chosen method solve problem AI algorithm called optimistic Gittins index. This algorithm identified average 1.85x asymptomatic, infected travelers random surveillance testing, 2-4x peak travel. After test results, found positive, put quarantine. Following collection significant data aforementioned process, a certain period, policies made categorizing separately imposing restrictions travelers specific location. This EVA presented operation August 6th November 1st processing around 38,500 PLFs day testing average 18.5% households entering country every day.
 Above mentioned applications show tip iceberg get developments watch include use Image Recognition identify covid based x-ray images, use Deep Learning predict 3-D protein structure associated COVID-19 on.
