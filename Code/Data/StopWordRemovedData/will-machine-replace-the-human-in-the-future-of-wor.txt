 “Anything could give rise smarter-than-human intelligence – form Artificial Intelligence, brain-computer interfaces, neuroscience-based human intelligence enhancement – wins hands beyond contest change world. Nothing even league.” 
 –Eliezer Yudkowsky, AI Researcher
 There’s denying robots automation increasingly part daily lives. Just look around grocery store, highway, everywhere. This makes us wonder AI replace human intelligence? What make relevant tomorrow? Let us try find answers questions more.
 Let’s understand Artificial Intelligence –
 Artificial Intelligence AI basically machines displaying intelligence. This seen a machine playing chess a robot answering questions Facebook. Artificial Intelligence broken different types. There AIs designed specific tasks, detecting a specific type cancer. However, also AIs multiple tasks, driving a car. There types AIs. Among top, important fields Machine Learning ML, Neural Network, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing NLP.
 Machine Learning idea machines able prove similar a human learns a skill. Machine Learning also allows optimization existing skill. Machine Learning used different fields application entertainment. Netflix uses Machine Learning recommend shows watch based shows already seen.
 Neural Networks algorithms modeled human brain. These algorithms think like thereby give similar results a human give. Artificial Neural Networks used medical fields diagnose cancers like lung cancer prostate cancer.
 Computer Vision idea computers visions. This allows things human beings potentially better human beings do, depending programming, camera used, etc. Computer Vision used autonomous vehicles navigation place another.
 Natural Language Processing idea computers listen say. An example Siri. Siri able listen demands, process means, provide answer based researched.
 Now know AI do, Let’s talk issue.
 MACHINE REPLACE HUMAN FUTURE WORK?                                                 
 AIs allow automation jobs, thereby replacing humans already do. This means job loss concentration wealth selected people. This could mean a destabilization society social unrest. In addition social unrest, AI improves time. This means becomes smarter, faster, cheaper implement better repetitive things humans currently do, preparing fast food. It predicted AI improve much 50 100 years AI become super intelligent. This means become even smarter intelligent human earth. According experts Elon Musk, could cause end human civilization. AI could potentially start a war against humans, burn crops sorts tragedies reserved human functions. At point, theory, stop AI would already thought obstacles prevent goal. This means cannot unplug machine, effect AI replace human intelligence.
 But, happen next 10 30 years?
 NO! The field Artificial Intelligence sophisticated enough human tasks humans currently do. Currently, AI smart enough empathetic humans cannot think strategically enough solve complex problems. AI solutions expensive go different tests standards implement. It also takes time AI improve. For example, Boston Dynamics, world’s top robotics company a robot 2009 needed assistance walk. Fast forward 2019, robot could walk could jump objects, backflips much more. In addition timing, takes time price technological solution drop a point affordable. For example, a desktop computer costs around $1000 1999 get a significantly powerful laptop exact price. AI go curve.
 But happens 10 30 years? Will AI make human intelligence obsolete? Maybe. As proven earlier AI become faster better cheaper. As happens, companies use AI technology automate jobs save money, increase productivity, importantly, stay competitive. As demonstrated, AI become better repetition use machine learning. The difference AI able learn faster time progresses due amount data available today. It also able learn machines similar machines learn optimize tasks important skills. However, AI also repetitive routine tasks better, also able understand emotional intelligence, ethics, creativity. This seen distinct example- IBM
 IBM uses IBM Watson program AI create a movie trailer. Fox approached IBM said a movie coming AI #Scifi horror. They asked IBM platform IBM Watson could a trailer reviewing watching footage searching scary,
 MACHINE REPLACE HUMAN FUTURE WORK?                                             
 Sad happy moments movie provoked quality emotions based machine programmed identify emotions a quantifiable manner. IBM Watson able generate a trailer movie Morgan. The result, a movie trailer created machines example – Google
 2018 google demonstrated AI assistance could take calls simple stuff. The AI able set appointment! What fascinating able understand nuances conversation. The receptionist thought a human calling her. That a primitive version possible technology. Eventually, able conversations human beings do, making sales jobs obsolete. example – AI generated art
 In 2018, a Paris art collective consisting students used artificial intelligence generate a portrait. It generated portrait painting studying a set fifteen thousand art images wiki art. It estimated worth thousand ten thousand dollars. The painting sold auction thirty-five thousand US dollars.
 However, cannot sure say AI replace human intelligence. This a society started asking hard questions questioning ethics. Elon Musk founded Open AI, a research lab whose whole purpose promote discover artificial intelligence a benefits humanity. In addition this, factors affect long-term outcome AI replacing human intelligence. Like, degree humans allow AI take over? Depending field, people even want Artificial Intelligence help them? Or prefer a human counterpart? While able control happens long run, definitely secure short-term future.
 Here top skills become obsolete near future
 Strategic creative thinking
 The ability think outside box human. There thousands upon thousands slightly different possible outcomes result every distinguishable action human mind ability judge experience programmed purposes a far sophisticated manner AI currently achieve. As billionaire founder Alibaba, Jack Ma famously said – “AI logic, human beings wisdom”.
 Conflict resolution negotiations
 With understanding complexities human-related processes ability improvise judge, far better equipped deal conflicts robots ever likely be.

 Emotional Intelligence Empathy
 AI able recognize faces images rarely successfully read feelings faces. Humans, lesser greater degrees, capable accurate analysis emotional subtext. With application intuition use delicately worded elusive languages, methods, able properly judge a person feels.
 Interpretation Gray Areas
 Robots computers function well presented quantifiable data. However, situation enters a gray area, whether term refers morals, processes, definitions robots likely falter.
 Critical thinking
 Humans capable responding indicators quality computers are. While AI system able analyze documents according true false statements made within text, judge whether well written analyze implication use certain words overall meaning content.
