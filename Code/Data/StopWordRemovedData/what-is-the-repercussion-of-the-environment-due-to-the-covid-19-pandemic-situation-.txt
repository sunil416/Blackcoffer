 Epidemics, general, direct indirect costs associated direct indirect measures adopted counter (control) epidemic generally short-run long-run economic social consequences. The 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak globally lead a significant setback entire globe. The case detected 26th December 2019 China.  The World Health Organization (WHO) prepared diagnostic kit 14th January 2020.
 As global coronavirus Covid-19 pandemic continues take hold every economy feeling it’s effect a high degree uncertainty taking a toll manufacturing sectors. Supply chain management important area opportunities community contribute various forms.  According data produced Supply Management’s Report Business show PMI (Purchasing Manager’s Index) declined 1% month February. Mainly a huge contraction Petroleum, Transportation Textile Industries. Although a fall inventory expected grow due supply chain disruptions leading inefficiencies material conversion continued advanced stocking protect production schedules. A analysis trading platform Forex claimed heavily 75% companies already reported supply chain disruptions 80% believing point would experience impacts a result Covid-19 disruptions. The effective shutdown industrial activity i.e. China, ground zero virus presented particularly difficult problems manufacturing firms worldwide. Imported goods invested investors set a significant setback.
 Several experiments carried different governments across globe restrict spread pandemic. Boris Johnson introduced herd immunity plan United Kingdom a failure followed a mitigate model India also tried initially stop spread Covid-19 virus. The last ultimate model countries applying Hammer Dance Model i.e. Lockdown Model estimated bring caseload 25-30%. The Lockdown model basically means buying time prepare vaccine kill virus.
 However, lockdown certain critical economic consequences add burden global distress. This explained using standard macroeconomic Keynesian model. The lockdown spread disease a direct negative shock aggregate consumption levels exports. This leads a contraction aggregate demand leads a fall market rate interest aggregate equilibrium output. The secondary effect commodity market investment demand function either increase owing a fall market rate interest, fall owing contraction aggregate demand. Clearly, contraction Aggregate Demand-side generates economic slowdown. On hand, restriction workers gathering workplace owing lockdown hurts production sectors need presence physical workers. Note software financial service-producing sectors exempted negative supply shock least short-run medium-run since works could easily carried based “work home” anthem. However, reverse migration workers indication a sharp cut production activities. This Aggregate supply shock leads situation stagflation. In recent announcements Reserve Bank India (RBI) ease liquidity system prove counterproductive provided aggregate supply shock, since escalation demand specifically non-traded products without adequate increase production (supply) would result inflation. In words, supply-side management must go hand hand demand-side policies. Even policies undertaken national level government, however, conditions improve much due shocks external sector trade commodities. Most imports banned increase economic cost production import substitutes within domestic territory based theory comparative advantage a Ricardian sense. At time, exports hurt due lower demand developed economies. This shows unemployment inflation inevitable near future.
 Corona Virus mainly affected raw material export-driven countries. With Covid-19 virus backdrop a decline orders, production, employment ease supplier deliveries demand less a mild decline inventories. There a huge revenue impact. Long stretches empty supermarket shelves shortage essential commodities visible impacts consumers global chain disruption caused Covid-19 pandemic. The uncertainties ahead swing extremes. As shortages worsen get resolved prices commodities could go consumers even laws exist against price gouging. At time keep mind constrained supplies could cause a decline demand turn end weakening prices. Risk Management process robust enough cope fallout coronavirus pandemic. The seemingly relentless forces globalization technology coronavirus backdrop present us supply chain challenges opportunities progress near future. There a glimmer good news countries globally haven taken preventive measures recovery fragile.
 The crisis due global pandemic likely serious developing economies compared global financial crisis 2008. This due fact global financial crisis leads lower demand exports developing economies developed nations lead contraction export-based industries sectors developing nations due inter-sectoral backward forward linkage effect, however, burden retrenchments formal sector absorbed informal sector. In present situation, problem vanishing informal sector evident since informal sector workers vulnerable spread disease due absence non-regulatory authority direct government control. Moreover, lockdown lead massive close informal units, thus informal sector present set vanishing due shock absorption capacity developing economy like India becoming weaker. The global economy drowning towards deep cycles economic depression aftershocks seem long-lasting. The global shock seems international policy coordination line needs domestic economies
